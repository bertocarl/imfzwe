<p>IMF Giving Together seeks opportunities to achieve synergies by combining IMF financial and equipment donations with the work of its employee volunteers. Because a priority of IMF Giving Together is to help improve economic and social conditions in the host city region, where nearly all IMF employees and their families reside, one-half of IMF Giving Together donations are made to local charities. The balance is donated to international nonprofit organizations with records of success in assisting poor families in low-income countries.</p>
<p>The IMF also supports local and international charities by matching at 50% those donations from IMF staff, retirees, and their families during the <a href="https://www.imf.org/redirect/?URL=$V&amp;404;https://www.imf.org:443/external/np/cpac/giving.htm">Annual Giving Campaign</a>.</p>
