<meta name="Description" content="The Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund were adopted at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference (Bretton Woods, New Hampshire) on July 22, 1944. They were originally accepted by 29 countries and since then have been signed and ratified by a total of 189 Member countries. As the charter of the organization, the Articles lay out the Fund's purposes, which include the promotion of 'international monetary cooperation through a permanent institution which provides the machinery for consultation and collaboration on international monetary problems'. The Articles also establish the mandate of the Organization and its members' rights and obligations, its governance structure and roles of its organs, and lays out various rules of operations including those related to the conduct of its operations and transactions regarding the Special Drawing Rights. The key functions of the IMF are the surveillance of the international monetary system and the monitoring of members' economic and financial policies, the provision of Fund resources to member countries in need, and the delivery of technical assistance and financial services. Since their adoption in 1944, the Articles of Agreement have been amended seven times, with the latest amendment adopted on December 15, 2010 (effective January 26, 2016). The Articles are complemented by the By-laws of the Fund adopted by the Board of Governors, themselves being supplemented by the Rules and Regulations adopted by the Executive Board." />

          <h2>Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund</h2>
        	<p class="date">March 2020</p>
        	
        	<!-- BEGIN INTRO TEXT AREA -->
        	<p>The Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund were adopted at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference (Bretton Woods, New Hampshire) on July 22, 1944. They were originally accepted by 29 countries and since then have been signed and ratified by a total of 189 Member countries. As the charter of the organization, the Articles lay out the Fund's purposes, which include the promotion of 'international monetary cooperation through a permanent institution which provides the machinery for consultation and collaboration on international monetary problems'. The Articles also establish the mandate of the Organization and its members' rights and obligations, its governance structure and roles of its organs, and lays out various rules of operations including those related to the conduct of its operations and transactions regarding the Special Drawing Rights. The key functions of the IMF are the surveillance of the international monetary system and the monitoring of members' economic and financial policies, the provision of Fund resources to member countries in need, and the delivery of technical assistance and financial services. Since their adoption in 1944, the Articles of Agreement have been amended seven times, with the latest amendment adopted on December 15, 2010 (effective January 26, 2016). The Articles are complemented by the By-laws of the Fund adopted by the Board of Governors, themselves being supplemented by the Rules and Regulations adopted by the Executive Board.</p>    <!-- END INTRO TEXT AREA -->

							<div>
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quotas and payment of subscriptions</h4>
								<p class="weotext">Each member shall be assigned a quota expressed in special drawing rights. The quotas of the members represented at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference which accept membership before December 31, 1945 shall be those set forth in Schedule A. The quotas of other members shall be determined by the Board of Governors. The subscription of each member shall be equal to its quota and shall be paid in full to the Fund at the appropriate depository.</p>
								
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustment of quotas</h4>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) The Board of Governors shall at intervals of not more than five years conduct a general review, and if it deems it appropriate propose an adjustment, of the quotas of the members. It may also, if it thinks fit, consider at any other time the adjustment of any particular quota at the request of the member concerned.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) The Fund may at any time propose an increase in the quotas of those members of the Fund that were members on August 31, 1975 in proportion to their quotas on that date in a cumulative amount not Art. II, Sec. 1–2 Art. III, Sec. 1–2 II. Membership; III. Quotas and Subscriptions 4 in excess of amounts transferred under Article V, Section 12(<em>f</em>)(i) and (<em>j</em>) from the Special Disbursement Account to the General Resources Account.</li>
									<li>(<em>c</em>) An eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for any change in quotas.</li>
									<li>(<em>d</em>) The quota of a member shall not be changed until the member has consented and until payment has been made unless payment is deemed to have been made in accordance with Section 3(<em>b</em>) of this Article.</li>
								</ul>	
								
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments when quotas are changed</h4>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) Each member which consents to an increase in its quota under Section 2(<em>a</em>) of this Article shall, within a period determined by the Fund, pay to the Fund twenty-five percent of the increase in special drawing rights, but the Board of Governors may prescribe that this payment may be made, on the same basis for all members, in whole or in part in the currencies of other members specified, with their concurrence, by the Fund, or in the member's own currency. A non-participant shall pay in the currencies of other members specified by the Fund, with their concurrence, a proportion of the increase corresponding to the proportion to be paid in special drawing rights by participants. The balance of the increase shall be paid by the member in its own currency. The Fund's holdings of a member's currency shall not be increased above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Article V, Section 8(<em>b</em>)(ii), as a result of payments by other members under this provision.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) Each member which consents to an increase in its quota under Section 2(<em>b</em>) of this Article shall be deemed to have paid to the Fund an amount of subscription equal to such increase.</li>
									<li>(<em>c</em>) If a member consents to a reduction in its quota, the Fund shall, within sixty days, pay to the member an amount equal to the reduction. The payment shall be made in the member's currency and in such amount of special drawing rights or the currencies of other members specified, with their concurrence, by the Fund as is necessary to prevent the reduction of the Fund's holdings of the currency below the new quota, provided that in exceptional  circumstances the Fund may reduce its holdings of the currency below the new quota by payment to the member in its own currency.</li>
									<li>(<em>d</em>) A seventy percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for any decision under (<em>a</em>) above, except for the determination of a period and the specification of currencies under that provision.</li>
								</ul>	
								
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitution of securities for currency</h4>
								<p class="weotext">The Fund shall accept from any member, in place of any part of the member's currency in the General Resources Account which in the judgment of the Fund is not needed for its operations and transactions, notes or similar obligations issued by the member or the depository designated by the member under Article XIII, Section 2, which shall be non-negotiable, non-interest bearing and payable at their face value on demand by crediting the account of the Fund in the designated depository. This Section shall apply not only to currency subscribed by members but also to any currency otherwise due to, or acquired by, the Fund and to be placed in the General Resources Account.</p>

							<div>
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;General obligations of members</h4>
								<p class="weotext">Recognizing that the essential purpose of the international monetary system is to provide a framework that facilitates the exchange of  goods, services, and capital among countries, and that sustains sound economic growth, and that a principal objective is the continuing development of the orderly underlying conditions that are necessary for financial and economic stability, each member undertakes to collaborate with the Fund and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates. In particular, each member shall:</p>
								<li></li><ul class="weotext">
									<li>(i) endeavor to direct its economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability, with due regard to its circumstances;</li>
									<li>(ii) seek to promote stability by fostering orderly underlying economic and financial conditions and a monetary system that does not tend to produce erratic disruptions;</li>
									<li>(iii) avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other members; and</li>
									<li>(iv) follow exchange policies compatible with the undertakings under this Section.</li>
								</ul></li>	
								
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;General exchange arrangements</h4>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) Each member shall notify the Fund, within thirty days after the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, of the exchange arrangements it intends to apply in fulfillment of its obligations under Section 1 of this Article, and shall notify the Fund promptly of any changes in its exchange arrangements.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) Under an international monetary system of the kind prevailing on January 1, 1976, exchange arrangements may include (i) the maintenance by a member of a value for its currency in terms of the special drawing right or another denominator, other than gold, selected by the member, or (ii) cooperative arrangements by which members maintain the value of their currencies in relation to the value of the currency or currencies of other members, or (iii) other exchange arrangements of a member's choice.</li>
									<li>(<em>c</em>) To accord with the development of the international monetary system, the Fund, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may make provision for general exchange arrangements without limiting the right of members to have exchange arrangements of their choice consistent with the purposes of the Fund and the obligations under Section 1 of this Article.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveillance over exchange arrangements</h4>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) The Fund shall oversee the international monetary system in order to ensure its effective operation, and shall oversee the compliance of each member with its obligations under Section 1 of this Article.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) In order to fulfill its functions under (<em>a</em>) above, the Fund shall exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members, and shall adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies. Each member shall provide the Fund with the information necessary for such surveillance, and, when requested by the Fund, shall consult with it on the member's exchange rate policies. The principles adopted by the Fund shall be consistent with cooperative arrangements by which members maintain the value of their currencies in relation to the value of the currency or currencies of other members, as well as with other exchange arrangements of a member's choice consistent with the purposes of the Fund and Section 1 of this Article. These principles shall respect the domestic social and political policies of members, and in applying these principles the Fund shall pay due regard to the circumstances of members.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Par values</h4>
								<p class="weotext">The Fund may determine, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, that international economic conditions permit the introduction of a widespread system of exchange arrangements based on stable but adjustable par values. The Fund shall make the determination on the basis of the underlying stability of the world economy, and for this purpose shall take into account price movements and rates of expansion in the economies of members. The determination shall be made in light of the evolution of the international monetary system, with particular reference to sources of liquidity, and, in order to ensure the effective operation of a system of par values, to arrangements under which both members in surplus and members in deficit in their balances of payments take prompt, effective, and symmetrical action to achieve adjustment, as well as to arrangements for intervention and the treatment of imbalances. Upon making such determination, the Fund shall notify members that the provisions of Schedule C apply. </p>
	
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Separate currencies within a member&#8217;s territories</h4>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) Action by a member with respect to its currency under this Article shall be deemed to apply to the separate currencies of all territories in respect of which the member has accepted this Agreement under Article XXXI, Section 2(<em>g</em>) unless the member declares that its action relates either to the metropolitan currency alone, or only to one or more specified separate currencies, or to the metropolitan currency and one or more specified separate currencies. </li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) Action by the Fund under this Article shall be deemed to relate to all currencies of a member referred to in (<em>a</em>) above unless the Fund declares otherwise. </li>

In making a waiver it shall take into consideration periodic or exceptional requirements of the member requesting the waiver.

									<li>(<em>b</em>) A member that has made a purchase under Section 3 of this Article will be expected normally, as its balance of payments and reserve position improves, to repurchase the Fund's holdings of its currency that result from the purchase and are subject to charges under Section 8(<em>b</em>) of this Article. A member shall repurchase these holdings if, in accordance with policies on repurchase that the Fund shall adopt and after consultation with the member, the Fund represents to the member that it should repurchase because of an improvement in its balance of payments and reserve position. </li>
									<li>(<em>c</em>) A member that has made a purchase under Section 3 of this Article shall repurchase the Fund's holdings of its currency that result from the purchase and are subject to charges under Section 8(<em>b</em>) of this Article not later than five years after the date on which the purchase was made. The Fund may prescribe that repurchase shall be made by a member in installments during the period beginning three years and ending five years after the date of a purchase. The Fund, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may change the periods for repurchase under this subsection, and any period so adopted shall apply to all members. </li>
									<li>(<em>d</em>) The Fund, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may adopt periods other than those that apply in accordance with (<em>c</em>) above, which shall be the same for all members, for the repurchase of holdings of currency acquired by the Fund pursuant to a special policy on the use of its general resources. </li>

									<li>(<em>h</em>) The Fund's policies under Section 3(<em>d</em>) of this Article may be supplemented by policies under which the Fund may decide after consultation with a member to sell under Section 3(<em>b</em>) of this Article its holdings of the member's currency that have not been repurchased in accordance with this Section 7, without prejudice to any action that the Fund may be authorized to take under any other provision of this Agreement. </li>

									<li>(<em>j</em>)
										<ul class="weotext">
											<li>(i) If a member's currency specified by the Fund under (<em>i</em>) above is not a freely usable currency, the member shall ensure that the repurchasing member can obtain it at the time of the repurchase in exchange for a freely usable currency selected by the member whose currency has been specified. An exchange of currency under this provision shall take place at an exchange rate between the two currencies equivalent to the exchange rate between them on the basis of Article XIX, Section 7(<em>a</em>). </li>
											<li>(ii) Each member whose currency is specified by the Fund for repurchase shall collaborate with the Fund and other members to enable repurchasing members, at the time of the repurchase, to obtain the specified currency in exchange for the freely usable currencies of other members. </li>

								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(i) propose to the member that, on terms and conditions agreed between the Fund and the member, the latter lend its currency to the Fund or that, with the concurrence of the member, the Fund borrow such currency from some other source either within or outside the territories of the member, but no member shall be under any obligation to make such loans to the Fund or to concur in the borrowing of its currency by the Fund from any other source;</li>
									<li>(ii) require the member, if it is a participant, to sell its currency to the Fund for special drawing rights held in the General Resources Account, subject to Article XIX, Section 4.

The Fund shall also issue a report concerning its action.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) A formal declaration under (<em>a</em>) above shall operate as an authorization to any member, after consultation with the Fund, temporarily to impose limitations on the freedom of exchange operations in the scarce currency.

cancellation</h4>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) In all its decisions with respect to the allocation and cancellation
of special drawing rights the Fund shall seek to meet the long-term
global need, as and when it arises, to supplement existing reserve assets
in such manner as will promote the attainment of its purposes and will
avoid economic stagnation and deflation as well as excess demand and
inflation in the world.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) The first decision to allocate special drawing rights shall take
into account, as special considerations, a collective judgment that there
is a global need to supplement reserves, and the attainment of a better
balance of payments equilibrium, as well as the likelihood of a better
working of the adjustment process in the future.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h4 class="weotext">Section 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allocation and cancellation</h4>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) Decisions of the Fund to allocate or cancel special drawing rights
shall be made for basic periods which shall run consecutively and shall
be five years in duration. The first basic period shall begin on the date
of the first decision to allocate special drawing rights or such later date
as may be specified in that decision. Any allocations or cancellations
shall take place at yearly intervals.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) The rates at which allocations are to be made shall be expressed
as percentages of quotas on the date of each decision to allocate.
The rates at which special drawing rights are to be cancelled shall be
expressed as percentages of net cumulative allocations of special drawing
rights on the date of each decision to cancel. The percentages shall
be the same for all participants.</li>
									<li>(<em>c</em>) In its decision for any basic period the Fund may provide, notwithstanding
(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) above, that:<br /><br />
										<ul>
											<li>(i) the duration of the basic period shall be other than five
years; or</li>
											<li>(ii) the allocations or cancellations shall take place at other
than yearly intervals; or</li>
											<li>(iii) the basis for allocations or cancellations shall be the quotas
or net cumulative allocations on dates other than the
dates of decisions to allocate or cancel.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>(<em>d</em>) A member that becomes a participant after a basic period starts
shall receive allocations beginning with the next basic period in which
allocations are made after it becomes a participant unless the Fund
decides that the new participant shall start to receive allocations beginning
with the next allocation after it becomes a participant. If the Fund
decides that a member that becomes a participant during a basic period
shall receive allocations during the remainder of that basic period and
the participant was not a member on the dates established under (<em>b</em>) or
(<em>c</em>) above, the Fund shall determine the basis on which these allocations
to the participant shall be made.</li>

made pursuant to any decision to allocate unless:<br /><br />
                  <ul>

decision; and</li>
	                  <li>(ii) the participant has notified the Fund in writing prior to
the first allocation of special drawing rights under that
decision that it does not wish special drawing rights to be
allocated to it under the decision. On the request of a participant,
the Fund may decide to terminate the effect of the
notice with respect to allocations of special drawing rights
subsequent to the termination.</li>
                  </ul>
                 </li> 
									<li>(<em>f</em>) If on the effective date of any cancellation the amount of special
drawing rights held by a participant is less than its share of the special
drawing rights that are to be cancelled, the participant shall eliminate
its negative balance as promptly as its gross reserve position permits
and shall remain in consultation with the Fund for this purpose. Special
drawing rights acquired by the participant after the effective date of the
cancellation shall be applied against its negative balance and cancelled.</li>

period or start a new basic period, if at any time the Fund finds it desirable
to do so because of unexpected major developments.</p>

									<li>(<em>b</em>) Before making any proposal, the Managing Director, after having
satisfied himself that it will be consistent with the provisions of
Section 1(<em>a</em>) of this Article, shall conduct such consultations as will
enable him to ascertain that there is broad support among participants
for the proposal. In addition, before making a proposal for the first

broad support among participants to begin allocations; he shall make

cancellation for a basic period, whenever he is satisfied

principles as the Fund may adopt from time to time:

of payments and gross reserve position is sufficiently
strong, but this will not preclude the possibility that a participant
with a strong reserve position will be designated
even though it has a moderate balance of payments deficit.
Participants shall be designated in such manner as will promote over time a balanced distribution of holdings of
special drawing rights among them.</li>

reconstitution under Section 6(<em>a</em>) of this Article, to
reduce negative balances in holdings of special drawing
rights, or to offset the effect of failures to fulfill the expectation
in Section 3(<em>a</em>) of this Article.</li>

							<h3>Schedule B: Transitional Provisions with Respect to Repurchase, Payment of Additional Subscriptions, Gold, and Certain Operational Matters</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">1. Repurchase obligations that have accrued pursuant to Article V,
Section 7(<em>b</em>) before the date of the second amendment of this Agreement
and that remain undischarged at that date shall be discharged
not later than the date or dates at which the obligations had to be discharged
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement before
the second amendment.</p>
								<p class="weotext">2. A member shall discharge with special drawing rights any obligation
to pay gold to the Fund in repurchase or as a subscription that
is outstanding at the date of the second amendment of this Agreement,
but the Fund may prescribe that these payments may be made
in whole or in part in the currencies of other members specified by
the Fund. A non-participant shall discharge an obligation that must
be paid in special drawing rights pursuant to this provision with the
currencies of other members specified by the Fund.</p>
								<p class="weotext">3. For the purposes of 2 above 0.888 671 gram of fine gold shall be
equivalent to one special drawing right, and the amount of currency
payable under 2 above shall be determined on that basis and on the
basis of the value of the currency in terms of the special drawing right
at the date of discharge.</p>
								<p class="weotext">4. A member's currency held by the Fund in excess of seventy-five
percent of the member's quota at the date of the second amendment of
this Agreement and not subject to repurchase under 1 above shall be
repurchased in accordance with the following rules:</p>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(i) Holdings that resulted from a purchase shall be repurchased
in accordance with the policy on the use of the
Fund's general resources under which the purchase was
made.</li>
										<li>(ii) Other holdings shall be repurchased not later than four
years after the date of the second amendment of this
Agreement.</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="weotext">5. Repurchases under 1 above that are not subject to 2 above, repurchases
under 4 above, and any specification of currencies under 2
above shall be in accordance with Article V, Section 7(i).</p>
									<p class="weotext">6. All rules and regulations, rates, procedures, and decisions in
effect at the date of the second amendment of this Agreement shall
remain in effect until they are changed in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement.</p>
									<p class="weotext">7. To the extent that arrangements equivalent in effect to (<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>)
below have not been completed before the date of the second amendment
of this Agreement, the Fund shall</p>
									<ul class="weotext">
										<li>(<em>a</em>) sell up to 25 million ounces of fine gold held by it on
August 31, 1975 to those members that were members
on that date and that agree to buy it, in proportion to their
quotas on that date. The sale to a member under this subparagraph
(<em>a</em>) shall be made in exchange for its currency
and at a price equivalent at the time of sale to one special
drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold, and</li>
										<li>(<em>b</em>) sell up to 25 million ounces of fine gold held by it on
August 31, 1975 for the benefit of developing members
that were members on that date, provided, however, that
the part of any profits or surplus value of the gold that
corresponds to the proportion of such a member's quota
on August 31, 1975 to the total of the quotas of all members
on that date shall be transferred directly to each such
member. The requirements under Article V, Section 12(<em>c</em>)
that the Fund consult a member, obtain a member's concurrence,
or exchange a member's currency for the currencies
of other members in certain circumstances shall apply
with respect to currency received by the Fund as a result
of sales of gold under this provision, other than sales to a
member in return for its own currency, and placed in the
General Resources Account.</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="weotext">Upon the sale of gold under this paragraph 7, an amount of the proceeds
in the currencies received equivalent at the time of sale to one
special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold shall be placed in
the General Resources Account and other assets held by the Fund under
arrangements pursuant to (<em>b</em>) above shall be held separately from the general resources of the Fund. Assets that remain subject to disposition
by the Fund upon termination of arrangements pursuant to (<em>b</em>) above
shall be transferred to the Special Disbursement Account.</p>
							</div>

							<h3>Schedule C: Par Values</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">1. The Fund shall notify members that par values may be established
for the purposes of this Agreement, in accordance with Article
IV, Sections 1, 3, 4, and 5 and this Schedule, in terms of the special
drawing right, or in terms of such other common denominator as is
prescribed by the Fund. The common denominator shall not be gold
or a currency.</p>
								<p class="weotext">2. A member that intends to establish a par value for its currency
shall propose a par value to the Fund within a reasonable time after
notice is given under 1 above.</p>
								<p class="weotext">3. Any member that does not intend to establish a par value for its
currency under 1 above shall consult with the Fund and ensure that its
exchange arrangements are consistent with the purposes of the Fund
and are adequate to fulfill its obligations under Article IV, Section 1.</p>
								<p class="weotext">4. The Fund shall concur in or object to a proposed par value within
a reasonable period after receipt of the proposal. A proposed par value
shall not take effect for the purposes of this Agreement if the Fund
objects to it, and the member shall be subject to 3 above. The Fund
shall not object because of the domestic social or political policies of
the member proposing the par value.</p>
								<p class="weotext">5. Each member that has a par value for its currency undertakes to
apply appropriate measures consistent with this Agreement in order
to ensure that the maximum and the minimum rates for spot exchange
transactions taking place within its territories between its currency
and the currencies of other members maintaining par values shall not
differ from parity by more than four and one-half percent or by such
other margin or margins as the Fund may adopt by an eighty-five percent
majority of the total voting power.</p>
								<p class="weotext">6. A member shall not propose a change in the par value of its currency
except to correct, or prevent the emergence of, a fundamental
disequilibrium. A change may be made only on the proposal of the
member and only after consultation with the Fund.</p>
								<p class="weotext">7. When a change is proposed, the Fund shall concur in or object
to the proposed par value within a reasonable period after receipt of
the proposal. The Fund shall concur if it is satisfied that the change
is necessary to correct, or prevent the emergence of, a fundamental
disequilibrium. The Fund shall not object because of the domestic
social or political policies of the member proposing the change. A
proposed change in par value shall not take effect for the purposes of
this Agreement if the Fund objects to it. If a member changes the par
value of its currency despite the objection of the Fund, the member
shall be subject to Article XXVI, Section 2. Maintenance of an unrealistic
par value by a member shall be discouraged by the Fund.</p>
								<p class="weotext">8. The par value of a member's currency established under this
Agreement shall cease to exist for the purposes of this Agreement
if the member informs the Fund that it intends to terminate the par
value. The Fund may object to the termination of a par value by a
decision taken by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting
power. If a member terminates a par value for its currency despite the
objection of the Fund, the member shall be subject to Article XXVI,
Section 2. A par value established under this Agreement shall cease
to exist for the purposes of this Agreement if the member terminates
the par value despite the objection of the Fund, or if the Fund finds
that the member does not maintain rates for a substantial volume of
exchange transactions in accordance with 5 above, provided that the
Fund may not make such finding unless it has consulted the member
and given it sixty days notice of the Fund's intention to consider
whether to make a finding.</p>
								<p class="weotext">9. If the par value of the currency of a member has ceased to exist
under 8 above, the member shall consult with the Fund and ensure that
its exchange arrangements are consistent with the purposes of the Fund
and are adequate to fulfill its obligations under Article IV, Section 1.</p>
								<p class="weotext">10. A member for whose currency the par value has ceased to
exist under 8 above may, at any time, propose a new par value for its
currency.</p>
								<p class="weotext">11. Notwithstanding 6 above, the Fund, by a seventy percent
majority of the total voting power, may make uniform proportionate
changes in all par values if the special drawing right is the common
denominator and the changes will not affect the value of the special
drawing right. The par value of a member's currency shall, however,
not be changed under this provision if, within seven days after the
Fund's action, the member informs the Fund that it does not wish the
par value of its currency to be changed by such action.</p>

							<h3>Schedule E: Transitional Provisions with Respect to Executive Directors</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">1. Upon the entry into force of this Schedule:</p>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) Each Executive Director who was appointed pursuant to
former Article XII, Sections 3(<em>b</em>)(i) or 3(<em>c</em>), and was in office immediately prior to the entry into force of this

							<h3>Schedule F: Designation</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">During the first basic period the rules for designation shall be as
follows:</p>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) Participants subject to designation under Article XIX,
Section 5(<em>a</em>)(i) shall be designated for such amounts as
will promote over time equality in the ratios of the participants'

their net cumulative allocations to their official holdings
of gold and foreign exchange.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) The formula to give effect to (<em>a</em>) above shall be such that

							<h3>Schedule G: Reconstitution</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">1. During the first basic period the rules for reconstitution shall be
as follows:</p>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>)
										<ul>
											<li>(i) A participant shall so use and reconstitute its holdings of
special drawing rights that, five years after the first allocation
and at the end of each calendar quarter thereafter,
the average of its total daily holdings of special drawing
rights over the most recent five-year period will be
not less than thirty percent of the average of its daily net
cumulative allocation of special drawing rights over the
same period.</li>
											<li>(ii) Two years after the first allocation and at the end of each
calendar month thereafter the Fund shall make calculations
for each participant so as to ascertain whether and to
what extent the participant would need to acquire special
drawing rights between the date of the calculation and
the end of any five-year period in order to comply with
the requirement in (<em>a</em>)(i) above. The Fund shall adopt
regulations with respect to the bases on which these calculations
shall be made and with respect to the timing of
the designation of participants under Article XIX, Section
5(<em>a</em>)(ii), in order to assist them to comply with the
requirement in (<em>a</em>)(i) above.</li>
											<li>(iii) The Fund shall give special notice to a participant when
the calculations under (<em>a</em>)(ii) above indicate that it is
unlikely that the participant will be able to comply with
the requirement in (<em>a</em>)(i) above unless it ceases to use
special drawing rights for the rest of the period for which
the calculation was made under (<em>a</em>)(ii) above.</li>
											<li>(iv) A participant that needs to acquire special drawing rights
to fulfill this obligation shall be obligated and entitled
to obtain them, for currency acceptable to the Fund, in a
transaction with the Fund conducted through the General
Resources Account. If sufficient special drawing rights to
fulfill this obligation cannot be obtained in this way, the participant shall be obligated and entitled to obtain them
with a freely usable currency from a participant which
the Fund shall specify.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) Participants shall also pay due regard to the desirability of pursuing
over time a balanced relationship between their holdings
of special drawing rights and their other reserves.</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="weotext">2. If a participant fails to comply with the rules for reconstitution,
the Fund shall determine whether or not the circumstances justify suspension
under Article XXIII, Section 2(<em>b</em>).</p>
							</div>
							
							<h3>Schedule H: Termination of Participation</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">1. If the obligation remaining after the setoff under Article XXIV,
Section 2(<em>b</em>) is to the terminating participant and agreement on settlement
between the Fund and the terminating participant is not reached
within six months of the date of termination, the Fund shall redeem
this balance of special drawing rights in equal half-yearly installments
within a maximum of five years of the date of termination.
The Fund shall redeem this balance as it may determine, either (<em>a</em>) by
the payment to the terminating participant of the amounts provided
by the remaining participants to the Fund in accordance with Article
XXIV, Section 5, or (<em>b</em>) by permitting the terminating participant to
use its special drawing rights to obtain its own currency or a freely
usable currency from a participant specified by the Fund, the General
Resources Account, or any other holder.</p>
								<p class="weotext">2. If the obligation remaining after the setoff under Article XXIV,
Section 2(<em>b</em>) is to the Fund and agreement on settlement is not reached
within six months of the date of termination, the terminating participant
shall discharge this obligation in equal half-yearly installments
within three years of the date of termination or within such longer
period as may be fixed by the Fund. The terminating participant shall
discharge this obligation, as the Fund may determine, either (<em>a</em>) by
the payment to the Fund of a freely usable currency, or (<em>b</em>) by obtaining
special drawing rights, in accordance with Article XXIV, Section
6, from the General Resources Account or in agreement with a participant specified by the Fund or from any other holder, and the
setoff of these special drawing rights against the installment due.</p>
								<p class="weotext">3. Installments under either 1 or 2 above shall fall due six months
after the date of termination and at intervals of six months thereafter.</p>
								<p class="weotext">4. In the event of the Special Drawing Rights Department going
into liquidation under Article XXV within six months of the date a
participant terminates its participation, the settlement between the
Fund and that government shall be made in accordance with Article
XXV and Schedule I.</p>
							</div>
							
							<h3>Schedule I: Administration of Liquidation of the Special Drawing Rights Department</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">1. In the event of liquidation of the Special Drawing Rights Department,
participants shall discharge their obligations to the Fund in ten
half-yearly installments, or in such longer period as the Fund may
decide is needed, in a freely usable currency and the currencies of
participants holding special drawing rights to be redeemed in any
installment to the extent of such redemption, as determined by the
Fund. The first half-yearly payment shall be made six months after the
decision to liquidate the Special Drawing Rights Department.</p>
								<p class="weotext">2. If it is decided to liquidate the Fund within six months of the date
of the decision to liquidate the Special Drawing Rights Department,
the liquidation of the Special Drawing Rights Department shall not
proceed until special drawing rights held in the General Resources
Account have been distributed in accordance with the following rule:</p>
								<blockquote><p class="weotext">
									After the distributions made under 2(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) of Schedule
K, the Fund shall apportion its special drawing rights
held in the General Resources Account among all members
that are participants in proportion to the amounts due
to each participant after the distribution under 2(<em>b</em>). To
determine the amount due to each member for the purpose
of apportioning the remainder of its holdings of each currency
under 2(<em>d</em>) of Schedule K, the Fund shall deduct the
distribution of special drawing rights made under this rule.</p></blockquote>
								<p class="weotext">3. With the amounts received under 1 above, the Fund shall redeem
special drawing rights held by holders in the following manner and
order:</p>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) Special drawing rights held by governments that have terminated
their participation more than six months before
the date the Board of Governors decides to liquidate the
Special Drawing Rights Department shall be redeemed in
accordance with the terms of any agreement under Article
XXIV or Schedule H.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) Special drawing rights held by holders that are not participants
shall be redeemed before those held by participants,
and shall be redeemed in proportion to the amount
held by each holder.</li>
									<li>(<em>c</em>) The Fund shall determine the proportion of special drawing
rights held by each participant in relation to its net
cumulative allocation. The Fund shall first redeem special
drawing rights from the participants with the highest
proportion until this proportion is reduced to that of the
second highest proportion; the Fund shall then redeem
the special drawing rights held by these participants in
accordance with their net cumulative allocations until
the proportions are reduced to that of the third highest
proportion; and this process shall be continued until the
amount available for redemption is exhausted.</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="weotext">4. Any amount that a participant will be entitled to receive in
redemption under 3 above shall be set off against any amount to be
paid under 1 above.</p>
<p class="weotext">5. During liquidation the Fund shall pay interest on the amount of
special drawing rights held by holders, and each participant shall pay
charges on the net cumulative allocation of special drawing rights
to it less the amount of any payments made in accordance with 1
above. The rates of interest and charges and the time of payment
shall be determined by the Fund. Payments of interest and charges
shall be made in special drawing rights to the extent possible. A participant
that does not hold sufficient special drawing rights to meet
any charges shall make the payment with a currency specified by the
Fund. Special drawing rights received as charges in amounts needed for administrative expenses shall not be used for the payment of interest,
but shall be transferred to the Fund and shall be redeemed first and
with the currencies used by the Fund to meet its expenses.</p>
								<p class="weotext">6. While a participant is in default with respect to any payment
required by 1 or 5 above, no amounts shall be paid to it in accordance
with 3 or 5 above.</p>
								<p class="weotext">7. If after the final payments have been made to participants each
participant not in default does not hold special drawing rights in the
same proportion to its net cumulative allocation, those participants
holding a lower proportion shall purchase from those holding a higher
proportion such amounts in accordance with arrangements made by
the Fund as will make the proportion of their holdings of special
drawing rights the same. Each participant in default shall pay to the
Fund its own currency in an amount equal to its default. The Fund
shall apportion this currency and residual claims among participants
in proportion to the amount of special drawing rights held by each and
these special drawing rights shall be cancelled. The Fund shall then
close the books of the Special Drawing Rights Department and all of
the Fund's liabilities arising from the allocations of special drawing
rights and the administration of the Special Drawing Rights Department
shall cease.</p>
								<p class="weotext">8. Each participant whose currency is distributed to other participants
under this Schedule guarantees the unrestricted use of such currency
at all times for the purchase of goods or for payments of sums
due to it or to persons in its territories. Each participant so obligated
agrees to compensate other participants for any loss resulting from
the difference between the value at which the Fund distributed its currency
under this Schedule and the value realized by such participants
on disposal of its currency.</p>
							</div>
							
							<h3>Schedule J: Settlement of Accounts with Members Withdrawing</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">1. The settlement of accounts with respect to the General Resources
Account shall be made according to 1 to 6 of this Schedule. The Fund
shall be obligated to pay to a member withdrawing an amount equal to its quota, plus any other amounts due to it from the Fund, less any
amounts due to the Fund, including charges accruing after the date of
its withdrawal; but no payment shall be made until six months after
the date of withdrawal. Payments shall be made in the currency of the
withdrawing member, and for this purpose the Fund may transfer to
the General Resources Account holdings of the member's currency
in the Special Disbursement Account or in the Investment Account in
exchange for an equivalent amount of the currencies of other members
in the General Resources Account selected by the Fund with their
concurrence.</p>
								<p class="weotext">2. If the Fund's holdings of the currency of the withdrawing member
are not sufficient to pay the net amount due from the Fund, the
balance shall be paid in a freely usable currency, or in such other
manner as may be agreed. If the Fund and the withdrawing member
do not reach agreement within six months of the date of withdrawal,
the currency in question held by the Fund shall be paid forthwith to
the withdrawing member. Any balance due shall be paid in ten halfyearly
installments during the ensuing five years. Each such installment
shall be paid, at the option of the Fund, either in the currency of
the withdrawing member acquired after its withdrawal or in a freely
usable currency.</p>
								<p class="weotext">3. If the Fund fails to meet any installment which is due in accordance
with the preceding paragraphs, the withdrawing member shall
be entitled to require the Fund to pay the installment in any currency
held by the Fund with the exception of any currency which has been
declared scarce under Article VII, Section 3.</p>
								<p class="weotext">4. If the Fund's holdings of the currency of a withdrawing member
exceed the amount due to it, and if agreement on the method of settling
accounts is not reached within six months of the date of withdrawal,
the former member shall be obligated to redeem such excess
currency in a freely usable currency. Redemption shall be made at
the rates at which the Fund would sell such currencies at the time of
withdrawal from the Fund. The withdrawing member shall complete
redemption within five years of the date of withdrawal, or within such
longer period as may be fixed by the Fund, but shall not be required
to redeem in any half-yearly period more than one-tenth of the Fund's
excess holdings of its currency at the date of withdrawal plus further acquisitions of the currency during such half-yearly period. If the
withdrawing member does not fulfill this obligation, the Fund may
in an orderly manner liquidate in any market the amount of currency
which should have been redeemed.</p>
								<p class="weotext">5. Any member desiring to obtain the currency of a member which
has withdrawn shall acquire it by purchase from the Fund, to the
extent that such member has access to the general resources of the
Fund and that such currency is available under 4 above.</p>
								<p class="weotext">6. The withdrawing member guarantees the unrestricted use at all
times of the currency disposed of under 4 and 5 above for the purchase
of goods or for payment of sums due to it or to persons within its
territories. It shall compensate the Fund for any loss resulting from
the difference between the value of its currency in terms of the special
drawing right on the date of withdrawal and the value realized in
terms of the special drawing right by the Fund on disposal under 4 and
5 above.</p>
								<p class="weotext">7. If the withdrawing member is indebted to the Fund as the result
of transactions conducted through the Special Disbursement Account
under Article V, Section 12(<em>f</em>)(ii), the indebtedness shall be discharged
in accordance with the terms of the indebtedness.</p>
								<p class="weotext">8. If the Fund holds the withdrawing member's currency in the Special
Disbursement Account or in the Investment Account, the Fund
may in an orderly manner exchange in any market for the currencies
of members the amount of the currency of the withdrawing member
remaining in each account after use under 1 above, and the proceeds
of the exchange of the amount in each account shall be kept in that
account. Paragraph 5 above and the first sentence of 6 above shall
apply to the withdrawing member's currency.</p>
								<p class="weotext">9. If the Fund holds obligations of the withdrawing member in the
Special Disbursement Account pursuant to Article V, Section 12(<em>h</em>), or
in the Investment Account, the Fund may hold them until the date of
maturity or dispose of them sooner. Paragraph 8 above shall apply to
the proceeds of such disinvestment.</p>
								<p class="weotext">10. In the event of the Fund going into liquidation under Article
XXVII, Section 2 within six months of the date on which the member withdraws, the accounts between the Fund and that government shall
be settled in accordance with Article XXVII, Section 2 and Schedule K.</p>
							</div>
							
							<h3>Schedule K: Administration of Liquidation</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">1. In the event of liquidation the liabilities of the Fund other than
the repayment of subscriptions shall have priority in the distribution
of the assets of the Fund. In meeting each such liability the Fund shall
use its assets in the following order:</p>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>) the currency in which the liability is payable;</li><br /><br />
									<li>(<em>b</em>) gold;</li>
									<li>(<em>c</em>) all other currencies in proportion, so far as may be practicable,
to the quotas of the members.</li>
								</ul><br /><br />
								<p class="weotext">2. After the discharge of the Fund's liabilities in accordance with 1
above, the balance of the Fund's assets shall be distributed and apportioned
as follows:</p>
								<ul class="weotext">
									<li>(<em>a</em>)
										<ul>
											<li>(i) The Fund shall calculate the value of gold held on
August 31, 1975 that it continues to hold on the date
of the decision to liquidate. The calculation shall be
made in accordance with 9 below and also on the
basis of one special drawing right per 0.888 671
gram of fine gold on the date of liquidation. Gold
equivalent to the excess of the former value over
the latter shall be distributed to those members that
were members on August 31, 1975 in proportion to
their quotas on that date.</li>
											<li>(ii) The Fund shall distribute any assets held in the
Special Disbursement Account on the date of the
decision to liquidate to those members that were
members on August 31, 1975 in proportion to their
quotas on that date. Each type of asset shall be distributed
proportionately to members.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) The Fund shall distribute its remaining holdings of gold
among the members whose currencies are held by the Fund in amounts less than their quotas in the proportions,
but not in excess of, the amounts by which their quotas
exceed the Fund's holdings of their currencies.</li>
									<li>(<em>c</em>) The Fund shall distribute to each member one-half the
Fund's holdings of its currency but such distribution shall
not exceed fifty percent of its quota.</li>
									<li>(<em>d</em>) The Fund shall apportion the remainder of its holdings of
gold and each currency<br /><br />
										<ul>
											<li>(i) among all members in proportion to, but not in
excess of, the amounts due to each member after the
distributions under (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>) above, provided that
distribution under 2(<em>a</em>) above shall not be taken into
account for determining the amounts due, and</li>
											<li>(ii) any excess holdings of gold and currency among all
the members in proportion to their quotas.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="weotext">3. Each member shall redeem the holdings of its currency apportioned
to other members under 2(<em>d</em>) above, and shall agree with the
Fund within three months after a decision to liquidate upon an orderly
procedure for such redemption.</p>
								<p class="weotext">4. If a member has not reached agreement with the Fund within
the three-month period referred to in 3 above, the Fund shall use the
currencies of other members apportioned to that member under 2(<em>d</em>)
above to redeem the currency of that member apportioned to other
members. Each currency apportioned to a member which has not
reached agreement shall be used, so far as possible, to redeem its currency
apportioned to the members which have made agreements with
the Fund under 3 above.</p>
								<p class="weotext">5. If a member has reached agreement with the Fund in accordance
with 3 above, the Fund shall use the currencies of other members
apportioned to that member under 2(<em>d</em>) above to redeem the currency
of that member apportioned to other members which have made agreements
with the Fund under 3 above. Each amount so redeemed shall be
redeemed in the currency of the member to which it was apportioned.</p>
								<p class="weotext">6. After carrying out the steps in the preceding paragraphs, the Fund
shall pay to each member the remaining currencies held for its account. </p>
								<p class="weotext">7. Each member whose currency has been distributed to other
members under 6 above shall redeem such currency in the currency of
the member requesting redemption, or in such other manner as may
be agreed between them. If the members involved do not otherwise
agree, the member obligated to redeem shall complete redemption
within five years of the date of distribution, but shall not be required to
redeem in any half-yearly period more than one-tenth of the amount
distributed to each other member. If the member does not fulfill this
obligation, the amount of currency which should have been redeemed
may be liquidated in an orderly manner in any market.</p>
								<p class="weotext">8. Each member whose currency has been distributed to other members
under 6 above guarantees the unrestricted use of such currency
at all times for the purchase of goods or for payment of sums due to
it or to persons in its territories. Each member so obligated agrees to
compensate other members for any loss resulting from the difference
between the value of its currency in terms of the special drawing right
on the date of the decision to liquidate the Fund and the value in terms
of the special drawing right realized by such members on disposal of
its currency.</p>
								<p class="weotext">9. The Fund shall determine the value of gold under this Schedule
on the basis of prices in the market.</p>
								<p class="weotext">10. For the purposes of this Schedule, quotas shall be deemed
to have been increased to the full extent to which they could have
been increased in accordance with Article III, Section 2(<em>b</em>) of this
Agreement.</p>
							</div>
							
							<h3>Schedule L: Suspension of Voting Rights</h3>
							<div>
								<p class="weotext">In the case of a suspension of voting rights of a member under
Article XXVI, Section 2(<em>b</em>), the following provisions shall apply:</p>
								<p class="weotext">1. The member shall not:</p>
								<ul class="weotext">

member shall cease to hold office.</li>
									<li>(<em>b</em>) The Councillor and Alternate Councillor appointed by

been suspended, another Councillor and Alternate Councillor
shall be appointed by such other members under
Schedule D, and, pending such appointment, the Councillor
and Alternate Councillor shall continue to hold
office, but for a maximum of thirty days from the date of
suspension.</li>
									<li>(<em>c</em>) The Executive Director elected by the member, or in
whose election the member has participated, shall cease

case:<br /><br />
										<ul>
											<li>(i) if more than ninety days remain before the next regular
election of Executive Directors, another Executive
Director shall be elected for the remainder of
the term by such other members by a majority of the votes cast; pending such election, the Executive
Director shall continue to hold office, but for a maximum
of thirty days from the date of suspension;</li>
											<li>(ii) if not more than ninety days remain before the next
regular election of Executive Directors, the Executive
Director shall continue to hold office for the
remainder of the term.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>

								<p class="weotext">4. The member shall be entitled to send a representative to attend
any meeting of the Board of Governors, the Council, or the Executive
Board, but not any meeting of their committees, when a request
made by, or a matter particularly affecting, the member is under
consideration.</p>

									<li>(<em>b</em>) Special drawing rights being held in an escrow account
