<h3 align=CENTER> <a name="A"></a>Objective of Assistance Program</h3>
<p> In accord with the IMF's first Article of Agreement, the objective
of the IMF's technical assistance<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> program
is to contribute to the development of the productive resources of member
countries by enhancing the effectiveness of economic policy and financial
management. The IMF's technical assistance program works to achieve
this objective in two ways. First, much of the IMF's technical assistance
seeks to support the efforts of members to <i>strengthen their capacity</i>&#8212;in
both human and institutional resources&#8212;to formulate and implement
sustainable, growth-oriented and poverty-reducing macroeconomic, financial, and structural
policies. Second, the IMF assists countries in the <i>design</i> of
appropriate macroeconomic and structural policy reforms, taking account
of the lessons learned by other countries in addressing similar economic
policy concerns. In both ways, IMF technical assistance provides a cooperative
framework for the sharing of knowledge and international experience,
in a lasting manner, with member countries.
<h3 align=CENTER> <a name="B"></a>Scope and Nature</h3>
<p> The IMF seeks to provide technical assistance as efficiently and effectively
as possible in its core substantive areas of competency, namely:
<p>
<ul>
<li>macroeconomic policy formulation and management;
<p>
<li> monetary policy; central banking; the financial system; and foreign
exchange markets and policy;
<p>
<li> fiscal policy, public finances, and fiscal management;
<p>
<li> macroeconomic, external, fiscal, and financial statistics.
</ul>
<p> The specific topics covered, and the relative emphasis given, are
very much influenced by the issues that emerge in the course of the
IMF's surveillance and program activities, such as the recent focus
on the links between high-quality growth and poverty reduction.
<p> The Annex to this Statement describes the technical assistance provided
by the functional departments of the IMF and summarizes the core areas
in which the IMF seeks to concentrate its technical assistance. The
IMF's regional (or area) departments, which are responsible for country-level
management of surveillance and program operations, collaborate closely
with the functional departments in the planning, implementation, monitoring,
and follow-up of technical assistance.
<p> <b>Mode of delivery.</b> Technical assistance is provided in a variety
of forms. These include staff missions from headquarters; the placement
of experts for periods ranging from a few months to a few years (depending
on the nature of the tasks to be done and the capacity and interest
of the countries concerned); the preparation of technical and diagnostic
reports; the delivery of training courses, seminars, and workshops;
and the on-line provision of advice and support from headquarters. Technical
assistance and training are also delivered from regionally-based centers.
<p> <b>Recruitment of experts. </b>The IMF provides the services of qualified
experts, either directly from its staff or from external sources. These
are often drawn from the staff, or former staff, of member country ministries,
institutions, and agencies. The IMF seeks to expand and review its roster
of experts, in order to ensure an adequate supply of well-qualified
specialists that are conversant with technical developments in their
particular fields of expertise. The principal approach to identifying
candidates is through the IMF's contacts with central banks, financial
supervision agencies, ministries of finance, tax and customs departments
and statistical offices. Advertising is also occasionally used for highly-specific
scarce skills. The importance of appropriate language, communication,
and pedagogic skills is recognized in the recruitment of staff and experts.
All IMF experts are professionally supervised and administratively backstopped
by technically-qualified IMF headquarters staff. The IMF's resident
representatives also liaise closely with experts during their assignments.
During staff visits, area departments may follow up on the implementation
of technical assistance-related policy advice and the work of experts.
<p> <b>Collaboration with other assistance providers. </b>The IMF is committed
to cooperate and collaborate with other providers of technical assistance.
The global decline in Official Development Assistance levels underscores
the need to ensure that duplication and overlap in coverage are avoided
and that technical assistance is delivered by the most appropriate source
within a carefully-coordinated framework. The limited character of the
technical assistance provided by the IMF offers a fruitful basis for
such collaboration, with the IMF's provision of experts usefully complemented
by technical assistance-related services and equipment offered by other
technical assistance agencies.
<h3 align=CENTER> <a name="C"></a>Determining Technical Assistance Priorities</h3>
<p> <b>The sources of demand for IMF technical assistance.</b> The IMF's
technical assistance services are one of the benefits and rights of
membership, and its provision, in almost all cases, is not related to
IMF conditionality (i.e., technical assistance would not be a requirement
as part of an IMF-supported program).<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Much
of the demand by countries for the IMF's technical assistance services
arises from the perception of recipient governments that such assistance
can play an important role in helping them to strengthen their implementation
of macroeconomic policies. As indicated above, the IMF's surveillance
and program activities may also generate requests for technical assistance
from the IMF. Specifically, it is often during discussions with country
authorities during Article IV consultations, or when designing and monitoring
IMF-supported programs, that the needs for capacity building and policy
strengthening are mutually recognized and the concomitant requirements
for technical assistance clearly identified. Recently, the IMF has given
added emphasis to the importance of a better integration of technical
assistance with its surveillance and program activities. In this regard,
it stresses the importance of encouraging countries to identify their
technical assistance needs and priorities well in advance, rather than
waiting for problems to emerge. Working in partnership, the IMF and
governments are thus moving further from a "reactive" to a more "proactive"
stance in the planning, prioritization, and delivery of technical assistance.
<p> <b>Linking technical assistance with surveillance.</b> This objective
is currently being pursued, on an experimental basis in two respects. First,
Technical Assistance Consultations (TCs) have been added to the agenda
of a selected number of Article IV missions. A TC provides an opportunity
for discussions on the effectiveness of past IMF technical assistance
and on the scope and direction of future possible assistance from the
IMF. Secondly, for countries facing critical capacity constraints in
their efforts to implement programs of economic and financial reforms,
the IMF initiated a pilot project involving the preparation of medium-term Technical Cooperation Action Plans (TCAPs).
These action plans are intended to comprise a comprehensive assessment
of a country's or sub-region's macroeconomic and financial management
weaknesses in the core areas of the IMF's work and an elaboration of
a technical assistance program for addressing these. Such exercises
are carried out by IMF staff and the country authorities with the active
participation and support of other interested donors. The preparation
of a TCAP is seen as the beginning of a dynamic process which would
involve a commitment by the authorities, the IMF, and other donors to
provide resources to implement the plan and jointly to monitor and adjust
its implementation over an agreed time period.
<p> <b>Unanticipated sources of demand.</b> Despite the intention to improve
projections of technical assistance requirements through the Technical
Assistance Consultations and TCAPs, some of the demand for technical
assistance from the IMF will still arise in response to unexpected changes
in the policy environment of a country&#8212;a change in government,
an unanticipated crisis, or an external shock. There is thus expected
to remain a continuing element of unpredictability in the demand for
technical assistance services, and an important characteristic of the
IMF's technical assistance program will remain its capacity to respond
quickly to such situations.
<p> <b>Prioritizing requests.</b> Technical assistance is provided only
when requested by a country's authorities.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
Since the demand for such assistance normally exceeds the resources
available from the IMF, a number of considerations are taken into account
in prioritizing country requests. Guidelines, in the form of the following
"filters," are used in considering requests.
<p> <b>Filter 1&#8212;Core specialization of the IMF. </b>The assistance
provided must fall within the substantive areas of technical assistance
recognized as being within the IMF's core areas of specialization listed
in the Annex to this report. The IMF provides technical assistance that
supports policy reform and builds institutional capacity.
<p> <b>Filter 2</b>&#8212;<b>Main program areas.</b> Technical assistance
must be clearly directed towards supporting one of five main program
areas. <br>
These are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> preventing or containing crises and their contagion effects in
non-program countries (principally systemically important non-industrial
countries and emerging market economies);
<p>
<li> implementing sustainable debt relief and poverty reduction programs
for low income countries (encompassing the full range of technical
assistance in support of both poverty reduction initiatives and policies
to restore macroeconomic stability);
<p>
<li> fostering and maintaining macroeconomic and financial sector stability
in countries not currently using IMF resources (largely middle income
and transition economies);
<p>
<li> promoting regional capacity building initiatives, including training
and, in some cases, regional integration efforts; and
<p>
<li> rehabilitating basic economic and financial institutions in post-conflict
situations.
</ul>
<p> <b>Filter 3&#8212;Key policy initiatives.</b> Assistance should be
focused on supporting the IMF's key policy priorities and initiatives.
While these will vary over time, at present they are as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Standards and codes</b>: <i>follow-up </i>assistance to help
countries bring their fiscal, financial, and statistical practices
(including legal instruments) in compliance with the standards and
codes that are under the auspices of the IMF. This would include technical
assistance to help countries undertake assessments of their compliance
with such standards;
<p>
<li> <b>Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP): </b><i>follow-up
</i>assistance to help countries address weaknesses identified in
an FSAP;
<p>
<li> <b>HIPC programs:</b> technical assistance for strengthened public
expenditure management systems to track the use of debt relief for
poverty reduction outlays as well as basic economic and financial
statistics improvement under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative;
<p>
<li> <b>Safeguarding IMF resources:</b> Assistance in support of strengthened
public expenditure management or central bank accounting and reserve
management practices (and associated legal instruments) as well as
addressing data misreporting issues;
<p>
<li> <b>Offshore financial centers:</b> assessments and introduction
of best practices; and
<p>
<li> <b>Policy reforms/institutional capacity building in support of
achieving macroeconomic viability:</b> For instance, revenue mobilization
efforts; strengthening sound monetary policy; developing macroprudential
and other statistical indicators.
</ul>
<p> <b>Filter 4&#8212;Impact and commitment. </b>A country's past track
record, and its degree of ownership and commitment, should receive a
large weight in appraising a request for technical assistance. These
factors could be offset by other considerations only in limited set
of cases, such as dealing with systemic countries or crisis situations.
At times, a change in government may result in stronger ownership and
better prospects for successful assistance, even where a poor track
record exists.
<p> <b>Filter 5&#8212;Regional diversity. </b>The principle of uniformity
of treatment of members requires that some diversity in technical assistance
resource allocation be maintained, and that small countries' needs,
where technical assistance can often have high impact and where other
sources of assistance may be unavailable, are not ignored.
<p> <b>Filter 6&#8212;Availability of external financing. </b>Although
availability of external financing should normally not be a decisive
factor, cooperation with other donors providing funding for IMF technical
assistance and/or to support other elements of assistance which the
IMF cannot easily provide (for example, equipment, in-country training,
systems development, local expertise, etc.) should be positively taken
into account when appraising requests for technical assistance.
<p> <b>Filter 7&#8212;Nature of the request. </b>Requests for a policy
or diagnostic mission, or short-term expert, are obviously less costly
than requests for a resident expert. Some of these requests can be met
without significantly impinging on the IMF's overall technical assistance
program resources, irrespective of their priority, unless they are likely
to have implications for longer-term follow-up assistance.
<p> <b>Filter 8&#8212;Regional approach.</b> Given the high cost of providing
assistance to small member countries, and in the light of common problems
even among some of the larger countries, the IMF will actively seek
opportunities for using regionally-based approaches to providing technical
assistance. In some situations, regional technical assistance centers
may be an efficient solution (the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance
Center (PFTAC), for example) and will be pursued.
<p> <b>Filter 9</b>&#8212;<b>Presence of other technical assistance providers.</b>
In deciding whether to provide assistance, the IMF will consider whether
other providers are actively engaged in similar efforts. Duplication
should be avoided, and where requests are made in such situations, all
efforts at coordination will be made.
<h3 align=CENTER> <a name="D"></a>Role of Recipient Governments in Realizing
Effective Technical Assistance</h3>
<p> <b>Strengthening recipient country ownership.</b> The IMF's technical
assistance program is based on the fundamental principle that to be
effective and to have a high impact, it is important to ensure that
a partner country is fully committed to owning the work associated with
the assistance and implementing the recommendations flowing from it.
This underscores the importance of having IMF technical assistance activities
planned and implemented with the full involvement of the recipient authorities
at each of the various stages of the process, from identification of
need through discussion and agreement on terms of reference and project
objectives, to implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Particularly
when it is intended to field a long-term expert&#8212;whether on a full-time
or peripatetic basis&#8212;close consultation with the authorities is
critical in order to ensure that the conditions are right for making
good use of an expert's time. Such consultation should result in reaching
agreement on the type of expert required; the needed qualifications
and experience; and, ultimately, on the individual chosen to provide
the technical assistance. A mutual review of the results of past and
current technical assistance efforts, including a country's track record
in the implementation of technical assistance recommendations, and a
consideration of future needs, are important aspects of the process
of enhancing ownership by recipient country authorities.
<p> <b>Charging policy of the IMF for its technical assistance. </b>In
line with the practice of other bilateral and multilateral agencies,
the IMF's technical assistance is generally provided free of charge.
The exception relates to the assignment of long-term experts (defined
as experts residing in a country for six months or more), for middle-
and upper-income countries which are asked to make a specified financial
contribution to the IMF. The IMF's management determines the precise
quantitative charges within a basic policy framework on country contributions
established by the IMF's Executive Board. Currently, middle-income countries
are expected to make a partial cash contribution and upper-income countries
are expected to reimburse the full cost of long-term technical assistance.
As a cooperative undertaking between the IMF and the requesting country,
the IMF recognizes that successful technical assistance requires careful
preparation and commitment of resources by the recipient authorities.
Important in this regard are the assignment of counterpart staff and
adequate complementary resources (for example, office space and equipment,
administrative support staff, communications facilities, material supplies,
and utilities), all of which amounts to a considerable real cost for
the recipient government, over and above whatever charges may be levied
by the IMF.
<h3 align=CENTER> <a name="E"></a>Monitoring and Evaluation</h3>
<p> <b>Development of a cost-effective and well-integrated system of monitoring
and evaluation.</b> Monitoring and evaluation are essential for ensuring
accountability and transparency in technical assistance activities;
for assessing their relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and impact;
and for drawing lessons on how to strengthen ongoing and future assistance
operations. The size of the IMF's technical assistance program, though
still modest by international standards, has reached a level requiring
the adoption of a systematic approach to technical assistance monitoring
and evaluation. Staff are in the process of preparing proposals in this
area, drawing on the experience and current practices of other agencies.
Monitoring needs to involve both IMF staff and country authorities in
order to ensure that all ongoing technical assistance efforts meet agreed
targets and objectives and produce the required outputs. Monitoring
also inevitably involves the making of evaluative-type judgments during
a project's lifetime, which are then used to improve ongoing implementation
efforts. In contrast, more analytical evaluation exercises generally
take a longer perspective, are often carried out independently of the
directly-involved staff (sometimes by external evaluators), and focus
mainly on completed operations or on completed operations of an ongoing
program.
<p> A common approach to monitoring and evaluation will be developed to
enable judgments across countries and selected subject areas, so that
lessons can be drawn and used to strengthen future operations. All monitoring
and evaluation activities will require input from the recipient authorities,
at the project and policy level, to ensure their views on the reasons
for success and failure of technical assistance are fully taken into
account. In-depth, thematic evaluation studies on selected topics are
expected to complement routine and comprehensive monitoring activities
by individual technical assistance departments. Such studies serve as
a cross-check on the consistency and quality of the advice rendered,
and allow for an assessment of the policy and capacity-building impact
of the technical assistance provided and of its sustainability. Independent
evaluations will also be undertaken, taking account of budgetary implications.
<h3 align=CENTER> <a name="F"></a>External Dissemination</h3>
<p> The IMF recognizes the importance of disseminating information on
its technical assistance activities of general interest both to the
membership and the public at large. One vehicle for this is the Annual
Report on Technical Assistance to the Executive Board, which summarizes
technical assistance activities and related policy developments over
the previous year, as well as the outcome of monitoring and evaluation
efforts. The report will also highlight any policy issues on which Board
guidance may be needed.
<p> In the interests of transparency and a public well-informed on key
economic policy matters, the IMF believes that information on the lessons
learned from the IMF's technical assistance program, as well as on the
assistance provided to individual countries, should be disseminated
as widely as possible. Thus, information on the <i>general substance
</i>of the IMF's technical policy advice in the different functional
areas is disseminated both through IMF research and other publications
(handbooks, occasional papers, and pamphlets, for example), and increasingly
on the IMF's external website. While the IMF recognizes the public interest
would also be served by the provision of information on the <i>country-
specific</i> advice tendered by the IMF, it is also important to recognize
that members may seek the IMF's technical advice on a confidential basis.
It is thus appropriate that a member country should have the right to
decide on whether to allow publication of this advice. For this reason,
individual technical assistance reports will continue to be circulated
on a restricted basis within the IMF, the World Bank, and other cooperating
donor agencies, with wider distribution contingent upon the permission
of the country concerned.
<h3 align=CENTER> <a name="G"></a>Internal Management of Technical Assistance</h3>
<p> Although the management of the IMF's technical assistance program
is largely devolved to individual departments, IMF-wide policies and
procedures governing the financing, planning, implementation, monitoring,
evaluation, and reporting are coordinated and developed by a senior-level
Technical Assistance Committee (TAC). Reporting directly to the Deputy
Managing Director responsible for technical assistance matters, the
TAC also acts as a forum for reaching agreement on recommendations to
management on the allocation of technical assistance resources across
the different geographic regions and functional areas. In addition,
it serves as the coordinator for pilot initiatives undertaken by the
IMF (such as the recent experiment with Technical Assistance Consultations
and Technical Cooperation Action Plans) and for the implementation of
the reforms that emanated from the Executive Board's June 1999 review
of the IMF's technical assistance activities. The TAC and its subcommittees
are supported by a small unit, the Technical Assistance Secretariat
(TAS), attached to the Office of Budget and Planning in the Office of
the Managing Director, which also assists in negotiating and administering
technical assistance agreements with other agencies and donors. The
TAS compiles aggregate data on planned and actual technical assistance
delivery for internal and external reporting purposes.
<h3 align=CENTER> <a name="H"></a>Role of External Financing</h3>
<p> In recent years, the IMF has sought to expand its range of contacts
and collaboration with other technical assistance providers. For example,
the IMF has cooperated with other donor agencies on a number of large-scale
integrated multi-year assistance projects of administrative and institutional
reform. Equally, the IMF's technical assistance program has benefited
from generous co-financing from a few multilateral and bilateral agencies,
which have supplemented the IMF's own budgetary resources for these
activities. As the IMF intensifies its efforts to help countries strengthen
their economic policy and financial management capacities, the pressure
of demand on its technical assistance resources is likely to increase
further&#8212;for work on implementing the new international codes and
standards; for work on strengthening the banking sector and financial
systems; for helping HIPC countries undertake debt sustainability analyses
and managing their debt reduction programs; and for public expenditure
management and statistical technical assistance in connection with the
design and implementation of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and IMF-supported
policy programs under the new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.
The IMF will seek every opportunity to cooperate with other agencies
in these areas. The Technical Cooperation Action Plans in particular
will require the close involvement of other donor agencies,<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>
since effecting and financing their implementation will greatly exceed
the technical assistance resources and instruments available to the
IMF.
<p> The IMF encourages member countries who have not yet done so to consider
providing such complementary financial support in order to enhance the
resources available for technical assistance, preferably in a manner
that is as unrestricted as possible. Meanwhile, the IMF's efforts to
deepen collaboration on technical assistance with its multilateral and
bilateral development partners will continue.
