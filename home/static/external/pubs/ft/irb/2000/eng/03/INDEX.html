What Are the Lessons Learned?</B></font><br>
<FONT COLOR=#004490>Mark De Broeck</font>
<P><I>The initial years of transition from a planned to a market-based economy in Central
Europe, Russia, and other countries of the former Soviet Union witnessed deep and long declines
in output and an upsurge in inflation. As of 2000, at the end of the first decade of the transition
process in these countries, growth had resumed and, with the exception of some slow reformers,
inflation had dropped to moderate or low levels. Only a handful of countries, however, have
returned to output levels at or exceeding those at the start of the transition. These developments
have prompted extensive research on the forces driving the behavior of output in the transition
economies and on the appropriate policies for achieving macroeconomic stability and sustained
growth. This survey reviews recent research conducted at the IMF in these areas.</I><sup><a
href="#1">1</a></sup>
<P>The unexpectedly deep and lengthy output declines early in the transition, and pronounced
differences in output performance across the transition economies, have been the motivation for a
number of quantitative studies of the determinants of output in transition.<sup><a
href="#2">2</a></sup> These studies typically pool cross-section and time-series data and
generally adopt a single-equation specification that relates a measure of output performance to a
set of explanatory variables, including those representing initial conditions, structural reforms,
and macroeconomic policies. While the size of the data sample, the degree of econometric
sophistication, and the range of explanatory variables differ across the studies, their broad
conclusions are the same&#8212;they support the view that slow progress in macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform plus unfavorable initial conditions (for example,
overindustrialization or distorted trade patterns) were associated with weaker output
performance. There are some differences, however, in the answers to more specific questions
regarding the relative importance of these explanatory variables and the dynamic patterns of their
effects.
<P>A number of papers attempt to offer a more comprehensive explanation of output
developments in transition. They include Hern&aacute;ndez-Cat&aacute; (1997), Fischer, Sahay,
and V&eacute;gh (1998a), Havrylyshyn, Izvorksi, and van Rooden (1998), and Berg and others
(1999).<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> All four papers confirm that macroeconomic
stabilization, progress in structural reform, and initial conditions&#8212;in the early years of transition
in particular&#8212;are key factors explaining output performance. But there are some significant
differences among the more specific findings. For instance, Fischer, Sahay, and V&eacute;gh
conclude that a fixed exchange rate regime affected growth positively. The other papers do not
find strong evidence supporting this view. As Hern&aacute;ndez-Cat&aacute; suggests, this may
reflect the fact that they include inflation as a separate variable, which may capture the indirect
impact of the fixed exchange rate regime on growth by helping to bring inflation down. Berg and
others find that structural reform has positive output effects already from the beginning of the
transition, while Havrylyshyn, Izvorksi, and van Rooden and also
Hern&aacute;ndez-Cat&aacute; argue that reform first had a negative effect. All four papers also
establish the significance of an aggregate measure of progress in structural reform, but obtain
different results when individual components that constitute the index are included separately.
<P>Other papers adopt the same panel growth regression approach, but focus on the
contributions of specific variables.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> Cristoffersen and Doyle
(1998) examine the role of export market growth and find this variable to be strongly associated
with output growth in transition. They also provide evidence that inflation above a threshold rate
in the low teens affected growth negatively, but that disinflation did not have a negative impact,
even in the moderate inflation range. Mercer-Blackman and Unigovskaya (2000) find countries
that implemented IMF programs early on and completed them successfully tended to have a
better growth performance. The program implementation indicator, however, is highly correlated
with an aggregate structural reform measure, suggesting that both indices could be related to an
underlying, unobserved factor such as commitment to reform.
<P>Reflecting the increasing importance attached to building effective institutions in support of
the market, Havrylyshyn and van Rooden (2000) add a separate set of variables measuring
institutional development to a benchmark panel growth regression. Their results retain the
significance of the core macroeconomic stabilization, structural reform, and initial conditions
variables, and show the institutional variables to have a significant, although small, additional
effect. Abed and Davoodi (2000) focus on the role of a corruption index in explaining key
measures of economic performance, including growth, in the transition economies. They argue
that corruption is largely a symptom of underlying structural and institutional weaknesses and
show that a structural reform variable has more explanatory power empirically than the
corruption index.
<P>The panel growth regression approach gives robust conclusions on the overall importance of
a core set of variables, but also suffers from limitations and methodological weaknesses. As
discussed above, studies based on this approach come to different conclusions regarding more
specific issues. Also, panel growth regressions do not necessarily perform well in explaining the
growth performance of individual countries. Focusing on the case of Uzbekistan&#8212;a slow
reformer with a better-than-average output performance&#8212;Zettelmeyer (1998) shows that a
standard panel estimation systematically underpredicts the country&#8217;s growth during the period
1992&#8211;96.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> Better results are obtained when
country-specific factors are taken into account.
<P>From a more methodological point of view, most panel studies tend to ignore the fact that
policy variables are not exogenous but, rather, depend on the economic environment. They also
do not take into account that some factors, initial conditions for instance, can influence growth
both directly and, by affecting policy capacities and choices, indirectly. These shortcomings
reflect the underlying weakness that the regression specifications generally involve a single
equation and are not based on a structural model of growth in transition.
Hern&aacute;ndez-Cat&aacute; (1997) is the only example in this literature of a study that
derives the estimated equation from a formal model. His model focuses on the reallocation of
capital from a less productive, old sector to a more productive, new sector, and shows that
stronger reform efforts may result in a steeper output fall early on, but a stronger recovery
later.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>
<P>The panel regression approach has been the most common framework to empirically study
growth in transition, but other methodologies have been applied as well. Fischer, Sahay, and
V&eacute;gh (1998a) use the coefficients estimated in the benchmark Barro (1991) and Levine
and Renelt (1992) growth regressions for market economies to assess the longer-run growth
prospects of the transition economies.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> Fischer, Sahay, and
V&eacute;gh (1998b) use the same approach but focus on a smaller sample of EU accession
candidates, and estimate that it could take the most advanced Central and Eastern European
countries less than two decades to catch up with low-income EU countries.<sup><a
href="#8">8</a></sup> This paper also tries to quantify the income losses incurred under central
planning, on average about one generation of growth.
<P>De Broeck and Kostial (1998) and De Broeck and Koen (2000a and 2000b) use a growth
accounting methodology to explain the output performance of Poland, Russia, and other
countries of the former Soviet Union.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> These authors conclude
that the output fall and subsequent recovery in the early years of the transition were accounted for
mainly by a sharp V-shaped movement in total factor productivity rates. Based on the experience
of Poland&#8212;the country with the longest record of sustained positive growth&#8212;factor accumulation
and sectoral reallocation to higher productivity sectors take on increasing importance as growth
becomes more robust. These insights are in line with the results obtained from panel growth
regressions, which indicate that factor input movements do not have important explanatory
power during the contraction and initial recovery phases. Keane and Prasad (2000) provide a
political economy interpretation of the relationship between inequality, transfers, and growth in
transition economies.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> Using a cross-section analysis, they
confirm that progress toward establishing a market economy enhances growth, but also find that,
conditional upon the degree of structural reform, policies that maintain a greater degree of
equality are more conducive to growth.

<a name="sum2"></a><font color="#004490" SIZE=5><b>Corruption</b></FONT><br>
<font color="#004490">Era Dabla-Norris</FONT>
<P><I>In recent years, the issue of corruption&#8212;generally defined as the abuse of public office for
private gain&#8212;has attracted renewed interest among both academics and policymakers. In growing
recognition of the adverse impact of corruption on economic performance and its ensuing impact
on the success of IMF programs, research within the IMF has contributed to the burgeoning
literature in this area by highlighting the impact of corruption on economic efficiency, equity, and
growth, while also providing insights into its origins, effects, and possible remedies.</I>
<P>The theoretical literature on the economic consequences of corruption has focused on the
detrimental impact of corruption on economic growth, efficiency, equity, and welfare.<sup><a
href="#1a">1</a></sup> Corruption reduces economic growth by lowering incentives to invest
and can be expected to lower the quality of public infrastructure and services, reduce public
revenues, misallocate talent to rent-seeking activities, and distort the composition of government
expenditures and of tax revenues. Empirical evidence based on cross-country comparisons does
indeed suggest that corruption has large, adverse effects on private investment and growth.
Mauro (1995), in the first study of its kind, used subjective indices of corruption produced by
private rating agencies to show that a country that improves its standing on the corruption index
from 6 to 8&#8212;a rating of 0 being the most corrupt and 10 being the least&#8212;will experience
something on the order of a 4 percentage point increase in its investment rate and a 0.5
percentage point increase in its annual per capita GDP growth rate.<sup><a
href="#2a">2</a></sup> Tanzi and Davoodi (forthcoming) discuss how corruption affects
growth through its impact on small- and medium-sized enterprises, which are often seen as the
engine of development.<sup><a href="#3a">3</a></sup>
<P>One specific way in which corruption may hamper economic performance is by distorting the
composition of government expenditures. Corrupt governments may shift spending away from
productive activities (such as health and education or high-quality physical infrastructure) and
toward the construction of "white elephant" projects or lower quality investments in
infrastructure that are not actually needed. This conjecture has been confirmed in a large number
of cross-section studies undertaken at the IMF.<sup><a href="#4a">4</a></sup> Empirical
evidence suggests that corruption reduces spending on government operations and maintenance,
and results in lower spending on health care and education services, such as medicine and
textbooks. Higher levels of corruption also tends to be associated with rising military spending.
<P>Corruption can also adversely affect the provision and the quality of publicly provided social
services by reducing government revenue.<sup><a href="#5a">5</a></sup> Reduced quality
may discourage individuals from using these services and make them less willing to pay for
them. Individuals would then engage more in tax evasion and firms would have greater incentive
to participate in the underground economy, which shrinks the tax base and further diminishes the
government&#8217;s ability to provide quality public services. Because corruption exacerbates an
unequal distribution of wealth and unequal access to education, and other means to increase
human capital, corruption can be expected to increase income inequalities and poverty.<sup><a
href="#6a">6</a></sup> Hindriks, Keen, and Muthoo (1999) find that distributional effects of
tax evasion and corruption are unambiguously regressive.<sup><a href="#7a">7</a></sup>
<P>The existing literature on the consequences of corruption leaves unanswered the question of
why, given the high costs of corruption, governments do not eliminate it. A possible answer is
that if corruption is systemic, the likelihood of detection and punishment decreases and
incentives are created for corruption to increase further. Individuals at the highest levels of
government may, themselves, have no incentives to control corruption or to refrain from taking
part in rent-seeking activities (discussed below). At the same time, eradication of corruption may
be costlier in countries where the level of institutional development and the general economic
environment is weak. Dabla-Norris and Freeman (1999) develop a model of the
interconnectedness of underdevelopment and corruption in which pervasive corruption
discourages market activity, thus reducing the incentives to allocate resources for eliminating
it.<sup><a href="#8a">8</a></sup> The mutual importance of corruption and economic activity
is illustrated by the model&#8217;s multiplicity of equilibria: one with low corruption and a high level of
economic activity, and the other with widespread corruption that discourages economic activity.
<P>The multiplicity of equilibria provides an explanation not only for the persistence of
corruption, but also for the observation that the incidence of corruption varies across countries,
even for similar activities. The existence of two stable equilibria in corruption suggests that, once
corruption becomes ingrained, it may be very difficult to eradicate. This leads to an important
policy implication: ad hoc, anticorruption campaigns will have little effect in eliminating
corruption. For anticorruption policy to be effective it must be sustained. An important question
is what characteristics make countries more likely to fall into a high-corruption, low-growth trap
in the first place.
<P>Corruption always results from a combination of opportunities and incentives. Opportunities
for the abuse of power are prevalent in areas where restrictions and government intervention lead
to the availability of rents, such as complex tax and customs systems, exchange rate controls and
financial market regulations, trade restrictions, windfall gains from natural resource wealth
privatization decisions, and discretionary public spending.<sup><a href="#9a">9</a></sup>
Empirical evidence suggests that the rule of law, particularly effective anticorruption legislation,
the availability of natural resources, the economy&#8217;s degree of competition and trade openness and
the country&#8217;s industrial policy affect the breadth and scope of corruption.<sup><a
href="#10a">10</a></sup>
<P>Incentives to engage in corrupt behavior are shaped, among other things, by the nature of
meritocratic recruitment and promotion in civil service, public sector salaries, the quality and
effectiveness of legal enforcement, the degree of transparency in government operations. Several
studies at the IMF demonstrate the link between low public sector salaries and high levels of
corruption in economies where monitoring is costly or ineffective and penalties for engaging in
corruption are low. Ul Haque and Sahay (1996) present a model that shows there is an optimal
level of wages that maximizes the government&#8217;s net revenues&#8212;that is, raising wages may more
than pay for itself in terms of increased tax receipts.<sup><a href="#11a">11</a></sup> Low
public sector wages, by attracting low-skilled human capital to the government sector, reduce tax
collections. The implication for the IMF&#8217;s policy advice is that wage cuts can undermine public
sector efficiency, and prescriptions for raising statutory tax rates, alone, may not increase revenue
collection. Dabla-Norris (2000) shows that, in the absence of appropriate institutional controls,
governments can economize on the costs of providing efficiency wages by allowing corruption to
take place.<sup><a href="#12a">12</a></sup> Empirical evidence points to a fairly robust link
between civil service pay and corruption across countries, suggesting that raising civil service
pay could be a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for preventing corruption.<sup><a
href="#13a">13</a></sup>
<P>Much of the more recent literature on this topic examines the political economy of
corruption. In a study of corruption in a representative democracy, Pani (2000) shows that
corruption reduces the level of taxes and public expenditures in equilibrium if citizens respond to
corruption by changing their votes and policy preferences.<sup><a href="#14a">14</a></sup>
Other studies argue that corruption patterns may be endogenous to political structures, with
institutionalized corruption often associated with kleptocratic states.<sup><a
href="#15a">15</a></sup> In this respect, recent empirical evidence on transition economies
suggests that initial conditions such as the past political history of a country and its propensity to
embark on structural reforms are important determinants of corruption.<sup><a

<P><I>IMF surveillance of the Japanese economy, and the policy advice that the organization
gives to the national authorities, has relied heavily on analytical work produced by the IMF staff.
The research agenda of the Japan desk has been driven, in large part, by the need to grapple with
evolving policy challenges. This article provides an overview of the recent research conducted by
the IMF staff on Japan.</I>
<P>With the Japanese economy experiencing its worst postwar crisis in recent years, the IMF&#8217;s
research agenda has shifted from its earlier emphasis on trade and exchange rate issues, to more
of a focus on why the 1990s became a "lost decade" for Japan, and the policy options and
tradeoffs involved in getting the economy back on track. Much of this research has been
collected in two recent books, Aghevli, Bayoumi, and Meredith (1998), and Bayoumi and
Collyns (2000).<sup><a href="#1b">1</a></sup> IMF staff have also published a number of
other articles on Japan.
<P>Why did the Japanese economy stagnate in the 1990s, and why is the recent recovery still so
fragile? This question constitutes the main theme of two recent papers&#8212;Bayoumi (1999) and
Ramaswamy and Rendu (1999).<sup><a href="#2b">2</a></sup> Both articles employ a vector
autoregression framework and identify the negative and persistent effects of the collapse of asset
prices in the early 1990s as the principal cause of stagnant output. While the focus of Bayoumi&#8217;s
paper is on identifying the channels through which the asset price collapse had a negative impact
on activity, the emphasis of Ramaswamy and Rendu&#8217;s article is more on how the collapse in asset
prices affected the different expenditure components, and it identifies the steep decline in private
investment as the main factor behind Japan&#8217;s disappointing economic performance in the 1990s.
Using somewhat different econometric techniques, both articles find that fiscal stimulus in Japan
has had a limited and waning impact on activity. The reasons for the steep decline in business
investment, and the impact that this decline had on capital stock and potential output in Japan
are, respectively, the main themes of Ramaswamy (2000) and Bayoumi (1999).<sup><a
href="#3b">3</a></sup>
<P>The issue of how monetary policy can provide support to the economy when interest rates are
close to zero has stimulated a lively debate in both academic and policy circles. Morsink and
Bayoumi (2000) shed light on this debate by analyzing the importance of the bank lending
channel in Japan, and identifying how the banking crisis has dampened the monetary
transmission mechanism by clogging up the lending channel. Using micro data on bank lending,
Woo (1999) provides additional evidence in support of the "capital crunch" hypothesis during
1997&#8211;98. Both of these papers point to the importance of resolving the banking problems
in Japan as a precondition for sustained economic revival. Towe (1998) addresses a different
issue concerning monetary policy&#8212;the identification of leading indicators of output and inflation
in Japan. Using time series techniques, Towe finds that the relationship between financial
variables and future output and inflation has been unstable in recent years, making the task of
conducting monetary policy all the more difficult.<sup><a href="#4b">4</a></sup>
<P>Activist fiscal policy has been one of the main tools used by the Japanese authorities in the
latter half of the 1990s to revive a faltering economy, and a number of "stimulus" packages have
been the primary conduit through which fiscal support has been provided. M&uuml;hleisen
(2000a) deconstructs the various stimulus packages, and sheds light on why they have had only a
limited impact on reviving activity. M&uuml;hleisen&#8217;s paper also shows that a sharp
deterioration in the tax elasticity played an important role in the worsening of Japan&#8217;s public
finances in the 1990s. The fiscal challenges facing Japan from a longer-run perspective,
particularly given population aging, are discussed in M&uuml;hleisen (2000b). Bayoumi (1998)
provides a primer for those seeking to understand Japan&#8217;s complex fiscal system.<sup><a
href="#5b">5</a></sup>
<P>Given Japan&#8217;s systemic importance for the global economy, exchange rate issues have
continued to be an important part of the IMF Japan desk&#8217;s research agenda.<sup><a
href="#6b">6</a></sup> Meredith (1998) develops a general equilibrium model to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the forces governing the exchange value of the yen, and the staff&#8217;s
approach to evaluating exchange rate misalignments. Ramaswamy and Samiei (2000) provide a
forward looking model of the exchange rate to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in the
yen-dollar market. Chadha and Prasad (1997) provide a structural vector autoregression model to
explore the types of shocks that have driven variations in the real exchange rate, and analyze the
relationship between the real exchange rate and the business cycle in Japan.
<P>As the Japanese authorities have embarked on the process of reforming their capital and
labor markets, the IMF&#8217;s research has also focused on structural issues.<sup><a
href="#7b">7</a></sup> Levy (2000) discusses the factors that are driving Japanese
corporations to restructure, and evaluates the effectiveness of recent restructuring efforts. Faruqee
(2000) develops a general equilibrium model to examine the economic implications of aging in
Japan and the policies designed to address it. Prasad (1997) analyzes the determinants of the
long-term trends in the sectoral composition of employment and output, shedding light on the
speed with which structural change has taken place over different time periods in Japan. Nagaoka
(2000) explores the links between labor and product markets in Japan.

<I>Adam Posen, Institute for International Economics</I>
<P><B>Manuel Conthe</B> and <B>Adam Posen </B>made the introductory remarks at the
conference. <B>Kemal Dervis</B>, <B>Michael Mussa</B>, and <B>Benn Steil </B>chaired
the sessions. <B>Alan Blinder</B>, <B>Barry Bosworth</B>, <B>Agust&iacute;n Carstens</B>,
<B>Andrew Hughes Hallett</B>, <B>Donald Kohn</B>, and <B>John Williamson</B> were
discussants of the papers, which are summarized below.
<P><B>Charles Freedman</B> observes that the combination of the central bank&#8217;s monopoly
power over the supply of reserves or settlement balances, and its ability to impose terms and
conditions related to the excess or shortfall of reserves or settlement balances, is crucial for
monetary policy implementation. The central bank&#8217;s control of the supply of reserves and
settlement balances reflects its advantages as provider of the mechanism to settle payments
imbalances among banks. These advantages, including the riskless character of the central bank
and its ability to act as lender of last resort, make it very unlikely that other mechanisms,
including variants of electronic money, will supplant the current types of arrangements for the
foreseeable future.
<P><B>Charles Goodhart </B>challenges the view that development of e-commerce and
associated computerization will eliminate the demand for a monetary base; and that such
vanishing demand for a monetary base will, in turn, limit the central bank from setting nominal
interest rates. He argues that the central bank&#8217;s ability to affect interest rates ultimately depends
on the fact that it is the government&#8217;s bank and, thus, has the power to intervene in (financial)
markets without concern for profitability (let alone profit maximization), while at the same time
its credit rating is higher than that of any other entity. Hence, the central bank can always dictate
the terms on either the bid, or ask, side of the money market. In addition, he stresses that
currency has unique features that make it difficult to replace. Currency is anonymous in the sense
that the recipient of a cash payment neither has to know, nor learn, anything about the
counterparty in the process of trade, allowing free transferability between users without recourse
to the underlying issuers.
<P><B>Michael Woodford</B> concludes that while advances in information technology may
require changes in the way monetary policy is implemented, the ability of central banks to control
inflation will not be undermined. He points out that the central bank only needs to be able to
control the short-term nominal interest rate. This ability will always be preserved as long as the
creditworthiness of the central bank remains unimpeachable. Under such circumstances, the
central bank could control short-term interest rates by standing ready to accept overnight deposits
or to lend overnight cash at a fixed rate. Indeed, the Bank of Canada, the Reserve Bank of
Australia, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand already control short-term interest rates by
<I>varying </I>the interest rate paid on balances held with the central bank. The successful
experiences of these central banks indicate that there is little reason to expect monetary control to
be any more difficult following the development of new electronic media for making payments.
<P>In their paper, <B>Stijin Claessens, Thomas Glaessner, and Daniela Klingebiel,</B> observe
that the financial industry is undergoing dramatic changes due to technological advances and the
advent of the Internet. In many countries, such evolution can accelerate the development of the
financial sector by reducing costs, increasing breadth and quality, and widening access to
financial services. They argue that advances in information technology are likely to reduce
asymmetric information, diminishing the importance of banks&#8217; "special" character. Consequently,
there will be a need to reevaluate (and probably reduce) the role of the safety net and prudential
regulation and supervision. On the contrary, the increasing globalization of financial markets
calls for an international harmonization of competition policy, and raises important consumer
protection issues.
<P>In his paper, <B>Richard Cooper</B> reviews the experience of industrial and developing
countries with fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes and observes that flexible exchange rates
have not performed as their early advocates insisted they would. Nominal exchange rate
flexibility has led to substantial real exchange rate volatility, creating a source of uncertainty for
business decisions. He then argues that, as capital market integration deepens, financial
movements will increasingly dominate changes in exchange rates. Financial movements will be
only loosely linked to changes in economic fundamentals, developing their own short-term and
medium-term dynamics, and the benefits that a flexible exchange rate provides as a
macroeconomic shock absorber will be increasingly dominated and eventually overwhelmed by
its costs as a generator of shocks unrelated to fundamentals. The worsening of this cost-benefit
ratio will make the case for a common currency among the world&#8217;s major economies.
<P><B>Robert Flood and Olivier Jeanne</B> investigate the scope for policy tradeoffs
involving interest rates, nominal-liability growth (money and bonds), the real government deficit,
and international reserve management in the context of a Krugman-Flood-Garber (KFG)
speculative attack model. They evaluate policies in terms of how long the policies preserve a
given fixed exchange rate. By adapting the KFG model to allow for an interest rate defense, they
show that increasing the domestic-currency interest rate makes domestic assets more attractive
according to an asset substitution effect, but weakens the domestic currency by increasing the
government&#8217;s fiscal liabilities. As a result, raising the interest rate hastens the speculative attack
when speculation is motivated by underlying fiscal fragility.
<P>In their paper, <B>Georg Rich</B> and <B>Michel Peytrignet</B> review the experience of
the Swiss National Bank (SNB) with monetary targeting and its switch to a policy based on
inflation forecasts. He observes that instabilities in base-money demand have been a factor in the
SNB decision to change its policy framework, and that financial innovation and the spread of
electronic money have contributed to errors in the SNB calculations. He also argues, however,
that these were not the main reasons that led to the policy switch, and that there was no evidence
that financial evolution has weakened the central bank&#8217;s control over monetary policy.
<P>In her paper,<B> Susan Lohmann</B> argues that well-designed institutions are credibly
committed to following a sound monetary policy, but are also flexible in the face of deep
uncertainty. They respond to economic and social developments as well as to shifting
understandings of the way the macroeconomy works. They accommodate political pressures,
renege on promises, and change their institutional stripes, and, if they become obsolete, they
disappear. She argues that mass democracy is uniquely well suited to support institutions that
implement a favorable credibility-flexibility tradeoff in monetary policy. Indeed, the rationale for
the creation of monetary institutions is to provide a public focal point for large audiences to
coordinate on when to apply punishments associated with the implementation of bad policies.
Optimal design then consists of setting up monetary institutions so they invoke the ideal
audience: the guardians of the guardians will have an incentive and ability to inflict costs on the
policymaker if he or she should break an agreement, thus generating credibility; but they would
also have an incentive and ability to excuse defections when extreme shocks or unforeseen
contingencies are realized, thus allowing for flexibility.
<P><B>Bennet McCallum</B> examines whether inflation targeting can be considered a
rule-based approach to monetary policy and discusses the future role of monetary rules in
general. Rule-based policies are characterized as policies that are conducted to satisfy
relationships specified from a "timeless perspective," that is, designed in a manner that is not
affected by current macroeconomic conditions. If this perspective is taken, the rules or
relationships can be updated periodically without imparting any inflationary bias, even if the
central bank&#8217;s objectives specify a target output rate that exceeds the natural rate value. Within
this framework, inflation targeting regimes largely represent rule-based policymaking. Regarding
the effects of a gradually diminishing role for money in developed economies, McCallum argues
that the feasibility and attractiveness of rule-based monetary policymaking will not be seriously
impaired as long as a tangible medium of exchange has some importance, even if it is small.
<P>Finally, <B>Adam Posen</B> compares monetary policy to war and uses that analogy to
discuss whether fighting inflation is actually a just war. First, he establishes the relevance of
"moral" reasoning for monetary policy by pointing out that not only policy goals, but also choices
about how and when disinflation is undertaken are important. Second, he argues that monetary
policy faces many of the same moral dilemmas raised by nuclear deterrence during the cold war.
Third, he turns to the topic of what grounds and goals are sufficient justification for undertaking
a costly disinflation. Fourth, he considers what means in the pursuit of those goals are ethically
supportable, and whether some damage-limiting efforts are incumbent upon monetary
policymakers. Finally, he looks at the duties of central bankers to keep their power to wage war
on inflation subject to democratic control, and to reduce the likelihood of such wars over time.

</B></FONT>
<P><P>The first annual IMF Research Conference was held in Washington, DC, on November
9&#173;10, 2000. Organized by the Research Department of the IMF, this event brought
together prominent researchers from various universities and institutions around the world and
young researchers in the IMF to present and discuss papers on topics of current policy interest.
The main themes of the conference were: private sector involvement in crisis resolution;
monetary and exchange rate policies in crisis situations; the effects of adjustment programs on
inequality, poverty and financial markets; and issues related to exchange rate regimes.
<P><B>Maurice Obstfeld</B> (University of California, Berkeley) delivered the first
<I>Mundell-Fleming Lecture</I> in which he reevaluated the famed Mundell-Fleming model, a
paradigm of international monetary economics for several decades, from a current perspective.

<B>The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union: Institutions, Performance, and Policy Issues</B>
<br><I>Frits van Beek, Jose Roberto Rosales, Mayra Zermeno, Ruby Randall, and Jorge
Shepherd</I>
<P>The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) is one of just a few <I>regional</I> central
banks in the world and is the only one where member countries pool their foreign reserves, the
convertibility of the common currency is self-supported, and the parity of the exchange rate has
not changed. The "strong Eastern Caribbean dollar" policy pursued by the ECCB has imposed
hard limits on its ability to extend credit to participating governments. As a result, a premium has
been placed on fiscal discipline, with most participating governments following prudent fiscal
policies.
<P>This paper argues that price and exchange rate stability have also contributed to regional
financial system stability. Despite the relatively frequent occurrence of major natural disasters,
and the secular decline of key economic activities, the financial systems in the Caribbean have
remained stable and virtually free of banking crises.

<br><b>Trade and Trade Policies in Eastern and Southern Africa</b></br>
<I>Arvind Subramanian, Enrique Gerlbard, Richard Harmsen, Katrin Elborgh-Woytek, and
Piroska Nagy</I>
<P>This occasional paper analyzes trade and trade policy developments in the countries of
Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) during the 1990s. It describes and quantifies the trade
liberalization undertaken by these countries in the area of goods and services, encompassing
unilateral and multilateral efforts as well as those undertaken in the context of regional
integration initiatives. Drawing upon the experience of individual countries, the paper explores
the macroeconomic aspects of trade liberalization, including the factors that have influenced
trade liberalization efforts and their impact on macroeconomic performance. Finally, it addresses
the main trade policy issues that ESA countries will confront given the impending changes in
their external trading environment.</FONT>

<b>Deposit Insurance: Actual and Good Practices</b><br>
<I>Gillian G.H. Garcia</I></FONT>
<p>In recent years, a number of countries that faced banking problems gave their banks&#8217;
depositors and creditors blanket guarantees; other countries explicitly initiated more limited
deposit insurance systems (DIS). All of these countries took steps to try and help stabilize their
financial systems, protect consumers, and facilitate economic recovery.
<P>This paper offers guidance on designing or reforming a limited DIS and on placing and
removing a full guarantee. To be successful, a DIS must set up a coordinated system of
incentives that encourages all parties dealing with banks to keep their financial institutions safe
and sound. That is, the system must avoid the pitfalls of moral hazard, adverse selection, political
interference, and regulatory capture. This paper also surveys the configurations of 67 presently
known DIS and traces a growing movement by countries toward the adoption of good deposit
insurance practices.

<b>Setting Up Treasuries in the Baltics, Russia, and Other Countries of the Former <BR>
Soviet Union</b><br>
<I>Barry H. Potter and Jack Diamond</I></FONT>
<p>Since 1992, the IMF&#8217;s Fiscal Affairs Department has supported the Baltics, Russia, and other
countries of the former Soviet Union by providing them with technical assistance to set up
treasury systems. In most advanced countries, treasury systems provide central governments with
comprehensive financial services&#8212;including processing of government payments and revenue
receipts, accounting, fiscal reporting, and financial management. The countries of the former
Soviet Union lacked comparable systems and faced the challenge of building treasury systems
from scratch. The IMF helped these countries meet this challenge through specific technical
assistance programs.
<P>The IMF conducted a self-evaluation of its technical assistance with a view to assessing: how
well the objective of setting up treasuries has been achieved; the relevance and sustainability of
the reforms; the costs, efficiency, and effectiveness of the assistance; and the factors that affected
the sources (or otherwise) in different countries. This paper presents the findings of this
evaluation, looks at the problems that arise when introducing institutional changes in transition
economies, and makes broader recommendations on assisting institutional change both in these
countries and elsewhere.

<p>The papers contained in this volume were presented at a conference hosted by the IMF and
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in Hong Kong SAR in November 1996. The conference
focused on a wide range of issues confronting policymakers in managing their sovereign assets
and liabilities in a world of mobile capital flows and integrated capital markets. The papers draw
on the experience of policymakers and private sector participants that have been actively
involved in formulating and implementing debt and reserves policy.

Establishing the Foundations of Sound Macroeconomic Management</B></FONT><BR>
<I>Luis M. Valdivieso, Toshihide Endo, Luis V. Mendonca, Shamsuddin Tareq, and Alejandro
L&oacute;pez-Mejia</I>
<p>This report provides an overview of the economic and institutional developments in East
Timor up until September 1999, and the immediate impact of the violent events that followed the
August 30, 1999, referendum to decide the future status of East Timor. It then presents the key
elements of the strategy recommended by IMF staff to the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to rebuild the institutions needed to support economic
activity and public administration, including external financing requirements, technical
assistance, and training needs in the area of macroeconomic management. Finally, the report
assesses the status of the strategy&#8217;s implementation, and discusses the steps that should be taken
to ensure the strategy will help prepare East Timor for future challenges.

<p>The Central Bank of Brazil and the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department of the IMF
held a seminar on inflation targeting in Rio de Janeiro on May 3&#173;5, 1999. Its purpose was
to analyze the experience, to date, of the countries that have been operating under an inflation
targeting framework, and to identify and review the steps that Brazil should consider in adopting
such a framework so as to enhance the chances of its success. This volume gathers together the
summaries of the presentations given at the seminar.

<a name="icm"></a><font color="#004490" SIZE=4><b>International Capital Markets Report, September 2000</b><BR> summary by Charles Kramer, Jens Nystedt and Jorge Roldos</font>
<P>The annual report on <I>International Capital Markets: Developments, Prospects, and Key
Policy Issues </I>is an integral element of the IMF&#8217;s surveillance of developments in
international financial markets. This year&#8217;s report assesses recent developments in mature and
emerging financial markets and analyzes key systemic issues affecting global financial markets.
During 1999 and into the first half of 2000, global financial conditions generally improved in
tandem with the strong rebound in the global economy. Starting in March 2000, however,
participants in mature and emerging markets became less at ease with the uneven growth patterns
among the major currency areas, signs of inflationary pressures, and increasing external
imbalances. Against this background, the report also discusses the major risks in the period
ahead.
<P>The <I>International Capital Markets</I> report examines three systemic issues. First, rapid
growth and widespread use of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets has accompanied, and
in many ways driven, the globalization of finance. These markets are comprised of
internationally active financial institutions, and are central to the functioning and efficiency of
the major bond, equity, and foreign exchange markets. Accordingly, OTC derivatives instruments
and markets have bestowed tremendous benefits on global financial markets. At the same time,
recent episodes of turbulence have revealed that OTC derivatives instruments and markets can
contribute to market instability. The report identifies sources of risks to market instability in OTC
derivatives markets as well as imperfections in the underlying infrastructure. Progress in
addressing some of these risks and imperfections has been limited, and the report points to areas
where further efforts are required if risks to market stability are to be avoided in the future.
<P>Second, the report discusses market views on the experience with initiatives to "involve" the
private sector in preventing and resolving crises. The report notes that it is in the interest of both
the private and public sectors to reduce potential inefficiencies and instabilities in the
international financial system. Recent experience with involving the private sector in crisis
resolution has revolved around two new instruments&#8212;the rollover of interbank lines and the
restructuring of sovereign foreign currency bonds. Views about the success of these instruments
are varied, but the report concludes that the official community needs to be more aware of how
the private sector will react to official initiatives in order to enhance private sector involvement
in the future.
<P>Third, the report documents the growing presence of foreign-owned institutions in the
emerging markets. In the second half of the 1990s, the share of assets under foreign control in
several emerging markets in Central Europe and Latin America increased to more than half of
total assets. Thus, foreign-owned banks have played an increasingly important role in emerging
markets. The report analyzes the factors that have stimulated the rise in foreign participation,
including those that drove global financial institutions to expand toward emerging markets, and
the factors underlying the authorities&#8217; decisions to remove existing barriers to entry. The
arguments for and against foreign presence in the financial system and the main policy issues are
also reviewed and assessed. The report finds that competitive pressures created by foreign bank
entry have led to improvements in banking system efficiency. It notes that while there is only
limited evidence on whether a greater foreign bank presence contributes to a more stable banking
system and decreased volatility in the availability of credit, foreign banks could potentially add to
the stability of the banking system. The report also suggests that the presence of foreign banks
opens a new channel for transmitting disturbances from mature to emerging markets. Finally, the
report points out that the main policy issues involved in foreign bank participation are the need to
coordinate and upgrade prudential supervisory and regulatory policies across borders, and to be
aware of concentrations of activity arising from large international bank mergers and of
associated systemic issues.

<FONT COLOR=#004490 size=4><a name="editor"></a><B>Editor&#8217;s Note</B></font><p>
The research summaries in this issue cover two areas that have been and continue to be subjects
of active research within the IMF in recent years. <I>Growth in Transition</I> summarizes a
large number of country-specific and cross-country studies that have tried to characterize and to
understand the determinants of the growth experiences of the transition economies of Eastern
Europe. The second research summary, <I>Corruption</I>, describes an area where research at
the IMF has been driven not just by analytical considerations but also by its relevance for the
operational work of the IMF.
<P><I>Country/Area Studies</I> is a new feature that is being introduced in this issue. These
short notes will summarize research done at the IMF on a particular country, or a regional group
of countries with common characteristics, and will highlight analytical work done in the IMF&#8217;s
area departments.
<P>This issue also contains a description of the <I>International Capital Markets Report, </I>an
annual publication of the IMF. A brief article summarizes the main themes and provides a summary of
the background material for the September 2000 report.
