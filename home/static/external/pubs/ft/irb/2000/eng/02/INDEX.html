<FONT COLOR=#004490 SIZE=5><B>The IMF: An International
Lender of Last Resort?</B></font><br>
<FONT COLOR=#004490>Olivier Jeanne</font>
<P><I>Since the 1994 Mexican crisis, the world has experienced several large financial rescue packages that were unprecedented in size and number. In the process, the IMF has refined its role as crisis manager, adopting newly designed facilities such as the Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) and Contingent Credit Lines (CCL). These changes in IMF lending practices have sometimes been interpreted as an evolution toward international lending in last resort&#8212;an evolution which, some have argued, should be further pursued and institutionalized.</I><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> <I>This summary reviews a selection of recent research papers that focus&#8212;or have some bearing&#8212;on the concept of international lending in last resort, and attempts to outline some directions in which this line of research is developing, particularly at the IMF itself.</I><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></FONT>
<P>The balance sheets of crisis-hit emerging economies exhibited large maturity and currency mismatches in the period leading up to the crisis. In the event, borrowers&#8212;whether public, as in Mexico or Russia, or private, as in Asia&#8212;were unable to roll over short-term debt, often denominated in foreign currency and held by a large number of uncoordinated creditors.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> Whether or not the ensuing crises were self-fulfilling runs continues to be debated, but it is generally accepted that maturity and currency mismatches made the crises more contagious internationally and, overall, more difficult to contain.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> Against this background, the provision of official crisis lending was often justified as the response to a systemic liquidity problem&#8212;the sort of problem that a lender of last resort is supposed to cope with at the domestic level.</FONT>
<P>The need for an <I>international </I>lender of last resort can be rationalized by the fact that emerging economies&#8217; external debt is mostly denominated in foreign currency, which <I>national</I> lenders of last resort hold in insufficient quantity to repay all creditors at short notice. From that perspective, the case for an international lender of last resort can be viewed as a simple transposition of the closed-economy analysis to the global level, the international lender of last resort providing the same service to central banks as the latter provide to their domestic banking sectors. The formal analogy between domestic and international lending in last resort is made clear by Goodhart and Huang (2000). In their model, the fragility of the banking sector and the limited ability of a domestic central bank to provide international liquidity to the interbank market can cause currency and banking crises. An international lender of last resort can then play a useful role in providing international liquidity and reducing international contagion.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></FONT>
<P>A too-direct transposition of the closed-economy analysis, however, may leave aside important aspects of the problem that are specific to the international dimension, argues Giannini (1999). In practice, domestic lending-in-last-resort policies and other financial safety nets are part of a broader policy and institutional framework that includes ex ante supervisory policies and powers of enforcement. The broader framework allows domestic policymakers to gather information, and to build a credible policy of &#8220;constructive ambiguity,&#8221; which help contain moral hazard and keep a reasonable degree of flexibility in responding to the unforeseeable circumstances of crises. Some features of the international environment, however, make it difficult to replicate this structure at the international level. This may explain why recent large-scale rescue packages have worked less than satisfactorily, according to Giannini.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></FONT>
<P>Another complication arises from the question of whether lending in last resort is intrinsically linked to the power of printing money or can be effectively implemented by an agency with a limited amount of resources. According to Capie (1998), effective international lending in last resort is impossible in the absence of an international currency issued by a global central bank. Eichengreen (1999) argues that, although an international lender of last resort does not necessarily have to print its own money, it would need an amount of hard currencies that is unrealistically large. The question of the required amount of resources for lending in last resort is crucial, since, as shown by Zettelmeyer (1999), lending less than the required amount may be worse than not lending at all.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></FONT>
<P>Jeanne and Wyplosz (2000) propose a formal framework to analyze the question of how large the international lender of last resort should be. They emphasize the importance of a distinction&#8212;originally made by Goodfriend and King (1988)&#8212;between &#8220;lending in last resort as an input in monetary policy&#8221; and &#8220;lending in last resort as an input in banking policy.&#8221;<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> In the former case, the lender of last resort provides aggregate liquidity to the market in an anonymous way, counting on market forces to allocate it optimally to the illiquid but solvent institutions. In the latter case, the lender of last resort provides liquidity to specific institutions on non-market terms under some conditionality. Jeanne and Wyplosz argue that the resources required by international lending in last resort are likely to be much larger if they are used as an input in domestic monetary policy, since in this case a substantial fraction of the additional reserves will be used to finance speculative capital outflows. By contrast, making international lending in last resort an input in domestic banking policy (for example, by restricting its use to the service of an insurance on foreign currency deposits in domestic banks) is likely to require a more realistic amount of resources. The second policy, however, supposes a deeper involvement of the international lender of last resort in domestic financial supervision and safety nets than can be supported by current institutional arrangements.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></FONT>
<P>An important question&#8212;which I shall only touch upon in conclusion&#8212;is the implication of lending-in-last-resort in terms of <I>moral hazard</I>. The recent international bailouts have been widely criticized for generating moral hazard, which encourages both emerging market countries and their creditors to undertake imprudent risks that ultimately materialize in damaging financial crises.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> This criticism would apply with even more force if bailouts came to be institutionalized as part of a systematic international lending-in-last-resort policy. As argued by Mussa (1999), however, the fact that insurance generates moral hazard is a universal argument against all forms of insurance. The more relevant question is whether moral hazard is contained within appropriate bounds, when compared with the real benefits of insurance. In a closed-economy context, the domestic authorities have to balance the benefits of financial safety nets in the event of a crisis against their implications in terms of moral hazard ex ante; and the terms of this trade-off can be improved ex ante by adequate regulation and supervision. As argued by Jeanne and Zettelmeyer (2000), international moral hazard could, in principle, be mitigated by making the extent of the lender-of-last-resort&#8217;s commitment to lend in the event of crisis conditional on the quality of domestic financial policies. Kumar, Masson and Miller (2000), on the other hand, argue that restricting international lending-in-last-resort to prequalified countries would increase instability.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> </FONT>

<font color="#004490" SIZE=5><b>Financial Contagion: ABC
Channels</b></FONT><br>
<font color="#004490">Haizhou Huang</FONT>
<P><I>Recent financial crises&#8212;those in Mexico, Asia, and Russia, in particular&#8212;have been accompanied by episodes of international financial market contagion. These crises fueled fears of systemic failure and global financial meltdown and raised important questions about financial contagion. For example, what are the main channels that transmit financial crisis from one country to another? How can international financial contagion be contained? These questions, central to the IMF&#8217;s role in the financial sector, have been an area of active research within the IMF and in the academic community. This brief note provides a short summary of research done on this topic at the IMF in recent years.</I></FONT>
<P>The literature on financial contagion focuses on the cross-country patterns of financial market contagion, an area in which the conventional macroeconomic explanations appear to be implausible. As discussed in Masson (1999a, 1999b), financial contagion may arise because of spillovers and jumps between multiple equilibria in international financial markets.<sup><a href="#1a">1</a></sup> The literature identifies three main channels for financial contagion, i.e., the <B>Asset market channel</B>, the <B>Banking channel</B>, and the <B>Currency channel</B>, which we term the ABC channels.<sup><a href="#2a">2</a></sup></FONT>
<P>The strand of literature on the asset channel abstracts from potential macroeconomic determinants of contagion and instead focuses on contagion as a financial market phenomenon. Extending an argument by King and Wadhawani (1990)&#8212;in that changes in the prices of assets in one market imperfectly reveal information on changes in the value of assets in other markets&#8212;Kodres and Pritsker (1998) build a multiasset rational expectations model in which, even if information is restricted to be uncorrelated across markets, contagion can still occur.<sup><a href="#3a">3</a></sup> Schinasi and Smith (1999) argue that the existence of financial contagion does not necessarily require recourse to market imperfections.<sup><a href="#4a">4</a></sup> In response to a shock to one asset, investors could find it optimal to sell many high-risk assets if they were leveraged and wished to diversify their investments and, thus, contagion in asset markets would emerge.</FONT>
<P>The asset channel of financial contagion is useful in explaining recent financial crises in emerging markets. Caballero and Krishnamuthy (1999) show that fire sales of domestic assets and possibly foreign exchange, together with the combination of weak international financial links and underdeveloped domestic financial markets, can trigger international financial crises in emerging markets.<sup><a href="#5a">5</a></sup></FONT>
<P>The strand of the literature on the banking channel seeks to extend the seminal contribution of Diamond and Dybvig (1983) from a run on one bank to a collapse of the entire banking system. The main building block of the banking channel is imperfection in the interbank market due to either information asymmetry or limited availability of liquidity.<sup><a href="#6a">6</a></sup> Aghion, Bolton, and Dewatripont (1999) show that the limited availability of liquidity in the domestic interbank market can cause contagious bank failures, because depositors, after observing a bank run, should draw the conclusion that liquidity in the interbank market has been exhausted and thus may start to run on their own banks.<sup><a href="#7a">7</a></sup> Huang and Xu (2000) argue that, because of information asymmetry among banks trading in the interbank market, a serious &#8220;lemon&#8221; problem in this market would prevent banks with liquidity surplus from lending to those in liquidity shortage, and thus lead to a collapse of the entire interbank market.<sup><a href="#8a">8</a></sup></FONT>
<P>The third strand of literature on financial contagion focuses on the currency channel. Flood
(1999) and Jeanne (2000) provide excellent surveys on this topic.<sup><a
href="#9a">9</a></sup> Empirical evidence, such as in Baig and Goldfajn (1998), emphasizes
that correlations in currency and sovereign spreads increased significantly during the Asian crisis,
whereas the equity market correlations offer mixed evidence.<sup><a
href="#10a">10</a></sup> Jeanne (1998) shows that international liquidity mismatch plays an
important role in creating conditions for currency crises. Jeanne (1997) and Jeanne and Masson
(2000) highlight the importance of sunspots in explaining currency crises.<sup><a
href="#11a">11</a></sup> In a study on transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe,
Russia, and the Baltics, Gelos and Sahay (2000) find that financial spillover patterns since 1993
in the more advanced transition economies were similar to those in their Asian and Latin
American counterparts.<sup><a href="#12a">12</a></sup></FONT>
<P>Since a currency crisis often triggers a banking crisis, and vice versa, both the banking and
currency channels may work together and generate the so-called &#8220;twin crises.&#8221; Goldfajn and
Valdes (1997) examine the twin crises in a unified framework whereby the interaction between
exchange rate collapses and bank runs transmits a currency crisis to a banking crisis and vice
versa.<sup><a href="#13a">13</a></sup> Goodhart and Huang (2000) show that, when central
banks operate under pegged exchange rate regimes, the fragility of the banking system and the
limited ability of a domestic central bank to provide international liquidity together can cause
contagion in the international interbank market, which can further lead to twin crises in many
economies.<sup><a href="#14a">14</a></sup></FONT>
<P>The ABC channels of financial contagion have important implications about how to contain
contagion.<sup><a href="#15a">15</a></sup> The literature on the asset channel suggests that
more diversification may raise costs of financial contagion. It emphasizes the importance of asset
market fundamentals. The literature on the banking channel highlights the critical role of
financial institutions, in particular, the interbank market in generating information and trading
liquidity, the central bank in providing urgent liquidity, and the availability of an international
lender of last resort.<sup><a href="#16a">16</a></sup> The currency channel literature
emphasizes the importance of external imbalances.</FONT>

<br><b>Macroprudential Indicators of Financial System Soundness</B><br>
<I>Owen Evans, Alfredo M. Leone, Mahinder Gill, and Paul Hilbers</I></FONT>
<P>Macroprudential indicators&#8212;defined broadly as indicators of the health and stability of
financial systems&#8212;can help countries assess the vulnerability of their banking systems to crises.
Work in this area has grown significantly in recent years, as part of the efforts to strengthen the
architecture of the international financial system.</FONT>
<P>This paper takes stock of current knowledge on macroprudential indicators&#8212;notably,
analytical, identification, and measurement issues&#8212;based on a survey of the literature and of
ongoing work by multilateral institutions, national central banks and supervisory authorities, and
rating agencies. The indicators covered encompass both aggregated indicators of the health of
individual financial institutions and their borrowers, and macroeconomic variables associated
with financial system soundness. The paper also looks at issues related to the use of
macroprudential indicators in IMF surveillance (including in the context of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program), and possible ways to encourage their dissemination to the
public.</FONT>

<br><b>Exchange Rate Regimes in an Increasingly Integrated World Economy</b></br>
<I>Michael Mussa, Paul Masson, Alexander Swoboda, Esteban Jadresic, Paolo Mauro, and
Andrew Berg</I>
<P>This paper considers the choice of an appropriate exchange rate regime for individual
countries in light of important recent changes in the world economy, in particular the general
increase in capital mobility and the abrupt reversals of capital flows to developing and transition
countries. The authors conclude that no single exchange rate regime is best for all countries in all
circumstances. While increased capital mobility has made exchange rate commitments more
difficult to sustain unless buttressed by a currency board or monetary union, thereby increasing
the prevalence of floating exchange rates in emerging market countries, intermediate regimes
such as adjustable and crawling pegs or bands are likely to remain viable, especially for
developing countries whose exposure to global financial markets remains limited.</FONT>
<P>Whatever regime is chosen, however, must be supported by policies consistent with it. As
concerns the exchange rate regimes for the world&#8217;s major currencies, the dollar, euro, and yen are
likely to continue to float, as those economies continue to devote their monetary policies to
domestic objectives. The paper also discusses the IMF&#8217;s advice to member countries on exchange
rate arrangements and provides statistical information on exchange rate regimes across the
world.</FONT>

<b>Fiscal and Macroeconomic Impact of Privatization</b><br>
<I>Jeffrey Davis, Rolando Ossowski, Thomas Richardson, and Steven Barnet</I></FONT>
<p>Privatization has been a key element of structural reform in many developing and transition
economies during the last decade. This paper examines the fiscal and macroeconomic issues
involved in the privatization of nonfinancial public enterprises in these economies. It considers
issues such as the factors determining the proceeds from privatization and the amount accruing to
the budget, the uses of such proceeds, the impact of privatization on the budget and on
macroeconomic aggregates, and the privatization component of IMF-supported
programs.</FONT>
<P>The empirical evidence draws on case studies of countries that reflect geographical diversity
and that are representative of a range of privatization experiences in developing and transition
economies. Data from the case-study countries suggest that privatization receipts channeled
through the budget are usually saved rather than spent, while other evidence suggests that, over
time, the fiscal situation tends to benefit from privatization, with greater revenues, lower
transfers, and a narrowing of deficits and possibly also of quasi-fiscal operations.</FONT>

<a name="con"></a><FONT COLOR=#004490 size=4><B>Seminar on Financial Risks,
System Stability, and Economic Globalization</b><br>
<I>Omotunde E. G. Johnson</I></FONT>
<p>
<I>The eighth Central Banking Seminar of the IMF was held June 5&#8211;8, 2000. It was
organized by the IMF&#8217;s Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department, in collaboration with the
IMF Institute.</I></FONT>
<p>In his opening remarks, First Deputy Managing Director <B>Stanley Fischer</B> described
the changing role of the IMF in the financial sector and noted the growing importance of
international standards in this area. Fischer noted that the crises that swept emerging market
nations in recent years left no one in any doubt about the importance of a strong and
well-regulated financial sector in dealing with capital flows. But in re-examining the proper role
of the IMF in the wake of these crises, he thought it fair to ask how the institution should
incorporate structural and other policies into its normal activities without moving too far away
from its central mandate with respect to macroeconomic policy. He underscored the rationale for
the IMF&#8217;s involvement in financial sector issues; namely, that the effectiveness of the economic
policies the IMF supports depends enormously on the state of the financial sector.</FONT>
<p><B>David Stephen and Michael Fischer</B> (Credit Suisse/First Boston) described internal
rating processes and models and discussed the issues that CSFB had faced in designing and
implementing its internal ratings process. An appropriate risk management system should
comprise both quantitative models as well as processes (building databases, validation and
benchmarking, testing and maintenance, review and audit).</FONT>
<p><B>Charles Monet</B> (J. P. Morgan &amp; Co) presented a technical paper on addressing
the problem of &#8220;wrong way credit exposure&#8221;&#8212;handling trades when there is an adverse
relationship between exposure size and counterparty default (exposure increasing at &#8220;the wrong
time&#8221;). Monet underscored the need to model market and credit risk in an integrated fashion in
order to have better estimates of the amounts exposed to counterparties.</FONT>
<p><B>Christopher Mahoney</B> (Moody&#8217;s Investor&#8217;s Service) argued that four factors could
help identify vulnerability: systemic solvency (the proportion of a system&#8217;s banks that are
insolvent); accounting transparency (opaque or bogus accounting); quality of supervision (lax
supervision); and funding stability (excessive reliance upon hot or noncore funding). He argued
that these four factors were necessary but not sufficient to cause a banking crisis. Rather two
things were sufficient: the injudicious introduction of market discipline (into a weak financial
system), and an external payments crisis.</FONT>
<p><B>David Llewellyn</B> (Loughborough University, U.K.) argued that there were seven
major components of a regulatory regime and that the objective of public policy should be an
optimal combination of those components in the design and implementation of an appropriate
regulatory strategy. He stressed the complementarity of the seven components and argued that the
optimal mix would change over time as market conditions and compliance culture
change.</FONT>
<p><B>Koichi Hamada</B> (Yale University) discussed the welfare costs of systemic risk,
financial instability, and financial crises. He illustrated, under some simplifying assumptions, that
the welfare loss (especially in terms of output and employment) from a systemic crisis will
depend on the probability of the crisis occurring, the duration of the crisis, the recovery rate of
defective claims and other damages, and the availability of facilities to dampen the disruption
(such as lender-of-last-resort facilities). He pointed out that the welfare cost of a financial crisis
would depend on the monetary regime.</FONT>
<p><B>Hiroshi Nakaso</B> (Bank of Japan) outlined some important features of the financial
crisis of Japan, which lasted with various degrees of severity for most of the 1990s; the factors
behind the crisis; and the conclusions and lessons that could be drawn for early warning signals
of banking crises. A central argument of his presentation was that, in addition to general
economic and market indicators, bank behavior could provide early clues to the development of
problems in the financial sector.</FONT>
<p><B>Edward Kane</B> (Boston College) reviewed the costs and benefits that fully informed
creditors would consider in deciding whether to recapitalize or liquidate an insolvent corporation.
He went on to identify the additional concerns and conflicts of interest that incompletely
informed taxpayers face when government regulators with short horizons manage the insolvency
of giant banks. In this context, regulatory decisions may exhibit dynamic inconsistency because
opportunistic forbearance offers personal and bureaucratic rewards, and officials who confront
bank insolvency in a timely way are threatened with substantial reputational and career penalties.
The model also indicated that dynamically inconsistent capital forbearance could emerge because
current taxpayers believe they can shift the costs of resolving bank insolvencies to future
taxpayers.</FONT>
<p><B>Akira Ariyoshi</B> (IMF) surveyed a number of issues related to the subject of
international capital mobility and domestic financial system stability. His basic message was that
capital mobility had major implications for financial system stability.</FONT>
<p><B>Andrew Powell</B> (Central Bank of Argentina) argued that emerging market
economies should pursue safety-first strategies in their monetary and financial policies. He cited
three important policy areas to illustrate the implications of a safety-first strategy: exchange rate
regimes, liquidity policies, and banking sector policies.</FONT>
<p><B>Jeffrey Davis and Timo Valila</B> (IMF) surveyed the main analytical issues related to
fiscal support in financial sector restructuring and illustrated their analysis by discussing the
recent experience of Korea and Thailand. They argued that the main role of fiscal policy in
financial sector restructuring was to extend financial support in a cost-effective and efficient,
transparent, and equitable way so as to minimize the risk of having to deal with moral hazard
problems. The use of fiscal instruments should preferably be accompanied by operational and
structural reforms aimed at addressing underlying problems.</FONT>
<p><B>Ydahlia Metzgen</B> (IMF) summarized the various initiatives at the national and
international level being pursued to improve the functioning of national and international
financial markets, took stock of progress to date, and offered a view of the challenges that lay
ahead. She highlighted important initiatives in which the IMF had been active, including the
Financial Sector Assessment Program. The IMF&#8217;s multilateral surveillance of international
economic and financial market developments had expanded and was playing an important role in
focusing the international community&#8217;s attention on the key financial market issues. The IMF was
also devoting increasing attention to regional surveillance and technical assistance.</FONT>
<p><B>Stefan Ingves</B> (IMF) discussed the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP):
its purpose, process, and the technical nature of its content. He also discussed the Financial
System Stability Assessment (FSSA), which is the paper prepared by the IMF staff for its
Executive Board following the IMF-World Bank FSAP mission and report for the country
authorities. The FSAP program is designed to identify and assess financial system strengths and
vulnerabilities from the perspective of best practice. Ingves discussed some of the analytical
approaches, including stress testing, used by FSAP missions. Linked to FSAP, there is substantial
financial sector analytical work under way in the IMF, particularly to develop macroprudential
indicators.</FONT>
<p>In a luncheon speech, <B>Orio Giarini</B> (Editor of <I>Geneva Papers on Risk and
Insurance</I>) underlined the importance of the insurance industry in the financial sector&#8212;in risk
management and risk transfer. He noted that governments had increasingly come to realize that
promoting an efficient private insurance system was important in ensuring a sound financial
system. <B>Malcolm Knight</B> (Bank of Canada), in his luncheon speech, discussed the role
of the central bank in fostering financial system stability and the experience of the Bank of
Canada in particular. A panel, comprising <B>Andr&eacute; Icard</B> (Bank for International
Settlements), <B>Carl Lindgren</B> (IMF), and <B>Manuel Conthe</B> (World Bank)
discussed the changing role of the IMF and the World Bank in assessing and promoting financial
system soundness in a global setting. Deputy Managing Director <B>Eduardo Aninat</B>, in his
closing remarks highlighted some of the main conclusions of the four days of
discussions.</FONT>

<a name="weo"></a><font color="#004490" SIZE=5><b>World Economic Outlook, May
2000</b></FONT>
<P>The projections and analysis contained in the semiannual <I>World Economic Outlook
(WEO)</I> are an integral element of the IMF&#8217;s ongoing surveillance of economic developments
and policies in its member countries and of the global economic system. The country projections
in the <I>WEO</I> are prepared by the IMF&#8217;s area departments on the basis of internationally
consistent assumptions about world activity, exchange rates, and conditions in international
financial and commodity markets. The May 2000<I> WEO</I> discusses the ongoing
improvement in the world economy since the financial market turbulence in 1997&#8211;98, but
also draws attention to several growing imbalances in global activity. These include the rising
external current account imbalances among the major currency areas, the apparent misalignments
of several key currencies compared with medium-term fundamentals, and the very high stock
market valuations around the world.<p>
The last point is considered in more detail in one of the background analytical chapters of the
May 2000 <I>WEO</I>, focusing on &#8220;<B>Asset prices and the business cycle</B>.&#8221; This
chapter first discusses the main determinants of asset prices and their linkages with economic
activity, and then assesses the policy implications arising from recent increases in prices and
volatility in asset markets. Two main challenges for macroeconomic policy are identified: to
prevent financial market excesses from spilling over to goods and services markets, thus
threatening macroeconomic stability; and to minimize the risk that sustained periods of asset
price inflation or deflation will undermine financial sector soundness. These considerations do
not imply that targeting a certain level of asset prices should become a macroeconomic policy
goal similar to inflation or monetary targeting. The chapter notes, however, that asset price
movements may convey valuable information about future developments in economic activity
and inflation, and that there are sound conceptual reasons and ample historical evidence in
support of policies that do not always accommodate asset price movements. Policies that &#8220;lean
against the wind&#8221; during cyclical upswings when asset prices appear to be rising too rapidly, or
that are loosened when downswings in activity lead to a sharp drop in asset markets, may
contribute to longer-term economic and financial stability.<p>
Another background chapter, assessing <B>&#8220;How can the poorest countries catch up?</B>,&#8221; is
motivated by the disappointing progress in raising real incomes and alleviating poverty in many
developing countries, and the recent renewed emphasis on debt relief and reduction in poverty.
The chapter considers, in particular, the impediments to growth in the developing countries that
have failed to prosper, and the policies that could lead to better economic prospects. While there
does not appear to be any single formula for kick-starting growth, experiences in the successful
developing countries indicate that macroeconomic stability, sound institutional arrangements,
and openness to trade are conducive to, or at least associated with, high sustainable growth.
Conversely, poor education and health, ineffective governance, weak rule of law, and war often
appear to be impediments to prosperity. The chapter points out that unsustainable debt burdens
can also reduce incentives for growth and development. It notes, though, that debt relief (such as
that available under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative) and other international
support need to be accompanied by domestic policy reforms to address the underlying causes of
the initial debt buildup.<p>
The final chapter of the May 2000 <I>WEO</I> provides an overview of key economic
developments and policy lessons of the twentieth century. This assessment focuses on three
interrelated areas&#8212;<B>the impact of technological change</B>, <B>developments in the
international monetary system</B>, and <B>the expansion in the role of the public sector</B>.
The chapter draws, in part, on two background studies, one prepared by Nicholas Crafts on
&#8220;Globalization and growth in the twentieth century,&#8221; (IMF Working Paper 00/44) the other by
Barry Eichengreen and Nathan Sussman on &#8220;The international monetary system in the (very) long
run&#8221; (IMF Working Paper 00/43).<p>
These background papers, together with the May 2000 <I>WEO</I>, are available in full-text
format at the <B>Research at the IMF</B> website at <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/res/index.htm">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/res/index.htm</a>. The
fall issue of the <I>WEO </I>will be available at this website on September 19, and the
published version will be available in October.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR=#004490 size=4><a name="editor"></a><B>Editor&#8217;s Note</B></font><p>
The research summaries in this issue cover two areas of considerable importance in recent
research and operational work at the IMF. The first concerns issues related to the IMF&#8217;s role as
international lender of last resort in the context of the new global financial architecture. The
second topic, a related one, is on financial contagion. As indicated by the extensive lists of
references, considerable research in both areas has been done and is ongoing, and this work cuts
across departments at the IMF.<p>
In addition to the usual contents, this issue also contains a description of one of the major
publications of the IMF&#8217;s Research Department: the <I>World Economic Outlook</I>. The main
themes in the latest issue (May 2000) of this semiannual publication, and some of the
background analytical material for the report, are summarized in a short article.</FONT><br>
