Growth</B></font><br>
<FONT COLOR=#004490>Atish R. Ghosh</font>
<P>Rapid output growth and low inflation are among the most
important objectives of macroeconomic policy. But are they complements? Or
are there trade-offs between lowering inflation and achieving high growth?
This question, central to the IMF's program and surveillance activities, has
long been an area of active research within the Fund, with more than two dozen
research papers written on the subject in the past five years alone.
<P>The focus of this literature is more the long-run
growth and inflation performance of countries than the short-run Phillips
curve considerations (though there has been a fair amount of research at the
Fund on the latter as well),<SUP><a href="#1">1</a></SUP> and part of the impetus for this
literature was the experience of the transition economies. It did not take
researchers long to notice that the transition economies that achieved low
inflation were also the ones that achieved the fastest turn around in output
growth.<SUP><a href="#2">2</a></SUP> Beyond the transition economies, two papers (not
written
at the Fund) were particularly influential. Fischer (1993) showed that high
inflation (presumably reflecting the distortive effects of relative price
uncertainty) was associated with lower GDP growth, while Bruno and Easterly
(1998) argued that "[while] the case for a negative association of inflation
and growth is firmly established when we look at the temporal association
of growth with discrete high inflation crises... the case for growth effects
of low to moderate rates of inflation remain very much ambiguous."<SUP><a
href="#3">3</a></SUP>
<P>Much of the research on inflation and growth
at the Fund has thus tried to answer three key questions: (i) is there a robust
negative relationship between inflation and growth? (ii) is there a "kink"
in the relationship so that, at very low levels of inflation, the relationship
is positive (perhaps due to Phillips curve effects)? (iii) does inflation
have to reach some minimum "threshold" before the growth effects become serious?
<P>Sarel (1996), in a panel study, argued that there
was indeed a (very) low inflation "kink" in the relationship (at around 8
percent), below which the relationship switches signs (inflation and growth
are positively correlated). Neither Sarel (1996) nor a subsequent paper by
Ghosh and Phillips (1998), however, found any evidence of a "threshold effect."<SUP><a
href="#4">4</a> </SUP> In fact, beyond the low inflation "kink," the negative relationship is
rather
smooth and <I>convex</I> &#8211;actually well approximated by a logarithmic function
so that the greatest <I>marginal</I> loss in growth occurs at low inflation
rates. A linear model, in which a 1 percentage point increase in the rate
of inflation has the same effect irrespective of whether the initial inflation
rate is 10 percent or 100 percent per year seems implausible. A logarithmic
model, in contrast, implies that <I>doubling</I> the initial inflation rate
has the same effect.
<P>The results suggest that the inflation-growth
relationship is less like falling off a precipice than like going down a playground
slide (the old-fashioned kind, with a ladder at the back, and a metal slide
in the front). Let the vertical height represent GDP growth, and the horizontal
distance traveled represent the inflation rate. Assuming the ladder is slightly
sloped forward, in the first few inches (initial low inflation) height rises
(GDP growth increases). The top of the ladder (and the beginning of the slide)
represents the "kink" point. Beyond that, height is lost rapidly at the start
of the slide (GDP growth falls quickly with increasing inflation); by the
end of the slide, the <I>marginal</I> loss in height is small, but the total
height off the ground is also low. (The slide analogy is sadly apt: many countries
find it easy to slip into high inflation and low growth; climbing back up
is rather more difficult.)
<P>These basic results have been confirmed in a
large number of panel, cross-section, and individual country studies undertaken
at the Fund.<SUP><a href="#5">5</a></SUP> The magnitude of the effect differs across
samples
and studies, but it is roughly on the order of &frac12; percentage point of (per
capita) growth for each doubling of the inflation rate (beyond the "kink").
Of course, these papers are careful not to make claims of causality, but it
is interesting to note that the statistical relationship between inflation
and growth remains even after controlling for the usual suspects--fiscal performance,
wars, droughts, population growth, openness, and even human and physical capital--and
allowing for simultaneity bias. More generally, attaining low inflation may
be part of a package of reforms, and a few papers have tried to look at interactions
and policy complementarities explicitly.<SUP><a href="#6">6</a></SUP>
<P>Much of the more recent and current research
on this topic tries to pin down more precisely the location of the "low" inflation
kink, and whether the estimated effects of inflation on growth depend, <I>inter
alia</I>, on the stage of economic development, the degree of capital mobility,
the structure of the economy, or the exchange rate regime (the sacrifice ratio
under money versus exchange rate based stabilizations is a literature unto
itself, and is not surveyed here).<SUP><a href="#7">7</a></SUP>
<P>As countries move down the inflation scale, and
reap the growth bonus, these issues will gain even greater importance--and
will surely continue to be active areas of research at the Fund.</FONT>

Non-Industrial Countries</B></font><br>
<FONT COLOR=#004490>Miguel A. Savastano</font>
<P>The adoption of inflation targeting (IT) as a framework
for monetary policy by a number of industrial countries in the early 1990s
made IT one of the most widely researched topics in the field of monetary
economics during the last decade.<SUP><a href="#f1">1</a></SUP> By the mid 1990s,
questions about the applicability of this policy framework to non-industrial countries
started to gather momentum. Unlike in the case of industrial countries, where
IMF work on IT developed in parallel with a large body of outside literature,
the Fund quickly became a major contributor to this area of research. In fact,
in the last four years IMF staff have produced more than twenty research papers
on the broad theme of the applicability of IT to non-industrial countries,
including some theoretical contributions motivated, at least partly, by the
interest in expanding IT beyond the realm of industrial economies.
<P>The early stage of this research program was
mainly exploratory. Studies at this stage were generally concerned with identifying
the prerequisites for the adoption of IT, clarifying the basic components
of the framework, assessing (formally, in some cases) the degree of compliance
with those prerequisites and components, and gauging the benefits of using
inflation targets as the main anchor for monetary policy in non-industrial
countries. The majority of studies focused on specific regions or countries,
mostly from Central and Eastern Europe and South East Asia.<SUP><a
href="#f2">2</a></SUP> The
two exceptions were the studies by Masson, Savastano and Sharma (1997) and
Eichengreen, Masson, Savastano and Sharma (1999), which examined the issue
of the applicability of IT to developing countries in general--though the
latter piece placed the question in a somewhat more restricted context.<SUP><a
href="#f3">3</a></SUP>
<P>As a number of emerging market countries actually
started to adopt IT as a monetary policy framework, or accelerated their "transitioning"
towards that framework, the Fund research in this area moved to a second stage,
and began to focus on specific aspects of the implementation and operation
of IT in those economies. Thus, for example, De Fiore (1998) examined econometrically
the relative importance of different transmission channels of monetary policy
in Israel under IT; Clifton (1999) also analyzed the experience of Israel
to illustrate the possible drawbacks of relying on target bands to anchor
inflation expectations; Leone (1999) documented the rapid implementation of
IT in Brazil following the currency crisis of early 1999; Mishkin and Savastano
(2000) illustrated the uneven transition towards IT in Chile, Colombia, Mexico,
Peru and Brazil during the 1990s; and Corker, Beaumont, van Elkan and Iakova
(2000) discussed the modifications to the IT framework that the Czech Republic
and Poland may need to consider as they approach the date of accession to
the European Union.<SUP><a href="#f4">4</a></SUP> The experience with IT of most of
these emerging
economies is comprehensively summarized in a forthcoming study by Schaechter,
Stone and Zelmer (2000) which, in addition, highlights the commonalities and
differences of the IT frameworks adopted by those economies compared to those
of industrial countries.<SUP><a href="#f5">5</a></SUP>
<P>The Fund's contribution to the theoretical literature
on IT was pioneered by Green (1996) who showed, in a modified Barro-Gordon
setting, that announcing inflation targets was not sufficient to eliminate
the "inflation bias" from monetary policy and, hence, to bolster credibility,
unless the central bank also announced output targets that were consistent
with the targets on inflation.<SUP><a href="#f6">6</a></SUP> Of the ensuing theoretical
work on this topic at the IMF the studies of Beddies (1999) and Jadresic (1999)
shed light on aspects of IT of particular importance for emerging economies.<SUP><a
href="#f7">7</a></SUP>
Using completely different models, both of which stress features that are
prominent in developing countries--the reliance on seigniorage and the presence
of "sticky-prices," respectively--these studies show that (strict) inflation
targeting will generally be associated with "excessive" output instability,
and that this result may or may not disappear under alternative specifications
of the problem.
<P>The growing interest on IT in emerging market
economies, and the various modifications and adaptations that the framework
is likely to undergo as it becomes adopted, and tested, in a larger sample
of (developing) countries makes this a very fertile area for future research,
both inside and outside the Fund.</FONT><P>

<P>The aim of this dataset is to provide a comprehensive set
of estimates of the international investment positions of 66 countries for
the period 1970&#8211;1997, using primarily balance of payments data on capital
flows. The estimates are based on existing stock measures, when available,
supplemented by the cumulation of capital flows, with appropriate valuation
adjustments. Gross international investment position data are available for
several industrial countries, typically starting in the 1980s For those countries,
the dataset provides a longer time series for assets and liabilities, based
on (adjusted) cumulative flow data. For developing countries, the contribution
of the dataset is more substantial because stock data are generally available
only for gross external debt and foreign exchange reserves (data on international
investment positions are available for only a few countries and a very limited
number of years). An additional contribution consists in adjusting the estimated
stock measures for equity and foreign direct investment so as to reflect,
albeit crudely, the effect of changes in market prices and exchange rates.
<P>The data would be of interest to applied international
economists working on international capital flows. The working paper describing
the data and methodology (IMF Working Paper 99/115, August 1999), along with
the dataset and the documentation, are publicly available through the <B><A HREF="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/res/index.htm">Research

<P>This conference, sponsored by the Statistics Department
and the Policy and Development Review Department, in Cooperation with the
Financial Stability Forum Working Group on Capital Flows, took place in Washington,
DC on February 23&#8211;24, 2000.
<P>The focus of the conference was on what actions
and resources would be required to provide better and more timely data on
capital flows and debt and what specific initiatives should be given priority.
Approximately 120 senior-level data users, policymakers, and data compilers
participated in the conference, which was intended to generate a dialogue
between data users and compilers, discuss recent initiatives to improve data
on capital flow and debt statistics, and identify priorities for further work
in this area.

<P>This seminar on Indonesian decentralization and its management,
sponsored by the World Bank and the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF,
was held in Jakarta, Indonesia on March 20&#8211;21, 2000. The seminar was
intended to provide the opportunity for an exchange of views on the next steps
for decentralization in Indonesia, given the country's political realities,
as well as the experiences of other countries. The forum included officials
from various central government agencies, as well as representatives of regional
governments, academics, international scholars, and participants with experience
in decentralization processes in other countries around the world.

<P><a name="con3"></a><FONT size=4><B><A HREF="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000/targets/index.htm">Conference on Implementing
Inflation
Targeting</A></B></font>
<P>A high-level seminar organized by the IMF Institute
on March 20&#8211;21, 2000 brought together top academics and policymakers
to discuss issues related to the implementation of inflation targeting. A
brief summary of the conference follows.
<P>Leading off, <B>Stanley Fischer</B> put inflation
targeting into a broader macroeconomic context. Inflation targeting may be
a means to attain the ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy, namely high and
stable growth. Fischer noted several examples of inflation targeting, as well
as potential cases where inflation targeting might be well suited.
<P>Relating inflation targeting to the older rules-versus-discretion
debate in macroeconomics, <B>Bennett McCallum</B> proposed <I>backward-looking</I>
rules to target either a monetary aggregates or an interest rate. His counterfactual
estimates suggest that if policy makers in several industrial economies adhered
to such a rule, inflation would have been substantially reduced over the past
three decades. He preferred targeting monetary aggregates (specifically, base
money) to interest rates since the former is simpler.
<P><B>Vincent Reinhart</B> noted that, to maximize
consumer welfare, policy makers should follow a <I>forward-looking</I> interest
rate rule. Such a rule is somewhat closer to inflation targeting as currently
practiced. <B>Lars Svensson</B> emphasized that inflation targeting regimes
helped policy makers focus on one goal, but not exclusively so. He noted that
it would be very difficult to eliminate the discretionary element from policy,
but that inflation targeting placed constraints on otherwise unconstrained
discretion. He also discussed the inherent tradeoff between price and output
variability.
<P><B>Michael Mussa </B>discussed, <I>inter alia</I>,
the most appropriate measure of inflation to be targeted. While omitting supply
shocks to petroleum and food might theoretically be desirable, the public
might have difficulty understanding the "cold and hungry CPI." <B>Timothy
Lane</B> discussed inflation targeting in the context of IMF programs. Care
must be taken, he emphasized, to assure that inflation goals are consistent
with other program targets like net domestic assets or net international reserves.
<P>Next, policy makers from several countries discussed
the actual implementation of inflation targeting. <B>Charles Freedman</B>
discussed the Canadian experience that started in 1991. After attempts to
restrain inflation by targeting monetary aggregates repeatedly failed, the
Bank of Canada shifted to inflation targeting. With limited success, exchange
rate movements were also included in a monetary conditions index. Considerable
emphasis was placed on both inflation forecasting and transparency.
<P><B>David Archer </B>noted that in New Zealand,
consumer price inflation, purged of interest payments, is recognized as the
only target and little attention is paid to intermediate indicators. The central
bank aims for clear and transparent communication with the public. Any country
faces a tradeoff between output variability and price variability. Archer's
research suggested that output variability is minimized at relatively low
rates of inflation and that inflation targeting had not boosted output variability
in New Zealand. <B>Andrew Haldane </B>stressed the proactive nature of inflation
targeting in the UK. Often, indications of future inflation are "ghosts",
not visible to the naked eye, and central bankers are cast in the role of
"ghostbusters". Owing to the long and variable lags in monetary policy, the
Bank of England devotes considerable resources to inflation forecasting.
<P><B>Leonardo Leiderman </B>suggested that when
inflation targeting was adopted in Israel, monetary policy discussions at
the central bank became substantially more focussed. Historically, inflation
had been high and the central bank lacked credibility. Thus, a key element
of inflation targeting, especially in light of recent budgetary imbalances,
would be a supportive fiscal policy. <B>Alejandro Werner</B> (in a paper co-authored
with <B>Agust&iacute;n Carstens</B>) noted that Mexico has been gradually moving
toward an inflation-targeting regime. In recent years, as inflation has fallen,
Mexico has published targets for both monetary aggregate and inflation. <B>Sergio
Werlang</B> discussed how inflation targeting emerged from the devaluation
of the Real in early 1999. As the country moved toward a more flexible exchange
rate and important fiscal adjustments were made, Brazilian policy became more
transparent and understandable for the public.
<P><B>Leonardo Leiderman</B> and <B>Eduardo Aninat
</B>provided some summary remarks.<br>

<a name="editor"></a><FONT size=4 COLOR=#004490><B>Editor's Note</B></font>
<p>The IMF is primarily a policy institution. As a basis for
its policy work, however, a significant amount of background research and
analytical work is done in various departments at the IMF. Much of this research
is original work while some of it is synthetic and draws mainly on work done
outside the institution.
<P>This quarterly bulletin will selectively summarize
key components of both types of research done at the IMF and will also provide
a listing of research documents and other research-related activities, including
IMF conferences and seminars. Most of this information is publicly available
on the IMF's website and relevant links are indicated below.
<P>I hope that this bulletin will serve as a useful
summary guide to research done at the IMF on various topics and also provide
a better perspective on the analytical underpinnings of the Fund's operational
work.<br>

<P>The IMF maintains a list of analytical and research
projects in progress in various departments at the Fund. The list is updated
periodically and is organized by department. Since the projects represent
work in progress, drafts of papers are generally not available. Nevertheless,
the list provides a glimpse into research currently underway at the Fund on
a variety of topics. This list can be found at the <B>Research at the IMF</B>
website (<I><A HREF="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/res/index.htm">http://www.imf.org/research</A></I>) under the title "<A HREF="../../../../../../np/res/ople/index.html">Ongoing Research
