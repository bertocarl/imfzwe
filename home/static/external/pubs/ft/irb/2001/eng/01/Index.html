<BR><BR>
<i>Over the past two to three years, there has been a resurgence of interest
in exchange rate regimes for developing and emerging market countries.
In the early 1990s, attention focused mainly on stabilization from high
levels of inflation and on the right regimes for the transition economies
in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The emerging market crises
of 1995&#173;98 completely changed this focus. Sustainability and crisis
prevention began to be viewed as key criteria for judging exchange rate
regimes. Much more attention was directed at the "hardness" of alternative
pegged regimes. The standard dichotomy of floats versus pegs was replaced
by a three-way distinction: floats, intermediate regimes, and very hard
pegs. More attention was also given to the distinction between exchange
rate regimes "de jure" and "de facto," as revealed by ex-post behavior.
Two main areas of research have arisen in this new context. The first
concentrates on the sustainability of intermediate regimes, while the
second deals with comparing and evaluating alternative regimes. This survey
briefly traces the debate since 1997, and discusses some recent research
conducted at the IMF.</i>
<BR><BR> In the aftermath of the Asian crisis, two propositions about exchange
rate regimes attracted widespread support. The first asserted that either
"extreme" (floats or hard pegs) was preferable to the "middle" (soft pegs,
bands, and crawling pegs), largely on the grounds that intermediate regimes
were hard to sustain and more crisis-prone than either extreme.<a href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Prior to the mid-1990s, the mainstream literature had basically argued
the opposite: in essence, because satisfying several objectives&#8212;flexibility
versus commitment, inflation stabilization versus competitiveness, and
insulation from monetary shocks versus insulation from real shocks&#8212;inevitably
pointed to compromise solutions between hard pegs and pure floats.<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>
The second proposition argued that, given the choice between the two extremes,
floating exchange rates were best for most emerging market economies,
with hard pegs reserved for "unusual circumstances."<sup><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>
Underlying this was the belief that only <i>very </i>hard pegs were sustainable,
that is, currency unions and currency boards supported by a strong national
consensus, and, as such, unfeasible or overly constraining for many emerging
market countries.
<BR><BR> What appeared to be a new consensus did not last long, however. First,
several authors reasserted the case that "intermediate solutions are often
more likely to be appropriate than corner solutions."<sup><a href="#f4">4</a></sup>
Second, the feasibility of <i>floating</i> was questioned by several authors,
particularly with respect to emerging markets in Latin America. This "fear
of floating" school argued that, because of credibility problems, worries
about inflation pass-through, and dollarization in the domestic financial
system, central banks sharply curtailed movements in the exchange rate
even when officially floating. This resulted in "flexible regimes that
are managed as if they were fixed, but without the benefits of precommitment."<sup><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>
<BR><BR> Two recent survey papers from the IMF can be viewed as proposing compromises
between the initial "bipolar" view and arguments in favor of intermediate
regimes.<sup><a href="#f6">6</a></sup> Fischer (2001) differs from the
original bipolar view in two respects: first, by recognizing that developing
countries which are not very exposed to international capital flows still
face a wide range of intermediate exchange regime options; second, by
defining flexible arrangements suitable for emerging markets more broadly
to include "crawling bands with wide ranges." Mussa and others (2000)
go somewhat further in defending intermediate regimes by making a distinction
between the sustainability and the desirability of pegs. The fact that
soft pegs may not be sustainable for many countries need not imply that
they cannot play a useful role for a limited period of time (for example,
as a nominal anchor during stabilization from high inflation). Of course,
this assumes that these countries find a way to safely "exit" from the
peg without a crisis.<sup><a href="#f7">7</a></sup>
<BR><BR> As an empirical matter, do intermediate regimes show signs of "vanishing"?
Fischer (2001) presents evidence for emerging markets and developing countries
indicating that the proportion of countries with intermediate regimes
has indeed declined during the period 1991&#173;99. But is this trend
likely to continue until intermediate regimes become extinct? This question
is addressed by Masson (2000), who estimates Markov transition probabilities
between the three states (hard pegs, floats, and intermediate regimes)
for various periods and sets of countries.<sup><a href="#f8">8</a></sup>
His evidence suggests that intermediate regimes will continue to exist
in steady state or, at least, take a very long time to disappear.<sup><a href="#f9">9</a></sup>
<BR><BR> No compromise seems to have developed, so far, in the central debate
on whether floating regimes or hard pegs are preferable for the majority
of emerging market economies. There is by now a substantial body of empirical
work, however, that sheds light on specific aspects of the debate.
<ul>
<li> Studies that link exchange rate regimes and economic performance
tend to find favorable effects of pegs, particularly hard pegs. Ghosh
and others (1995, 1997) find that inflation tends to be lower under
pegged regimes (which are defined to include both soft and hard pegs),
while output volatility is higher under pegs.<sup><a href="#f10">10</a></sup>
Ghosh, Gulde, and Wolf (1998, 2000) find that currency boards exhibit
better inflation performance than soft pegs, mostly due to a credibility
effect.<sup><a href="#f11">11</a></sup> Regarding growth, both currency
boards and floats seem to do better than soft pegs. A separate set of
papers finds no systematic evidence linking pegs and banking crises;
if anything, <i>hard</i> pegs seem to be associated with a lower probability
of banking crises than both floats and soft pegs.<sup><a href="#f12">12</a></sup>
</li><li> Full dollarization is likely to imply a further credibility effect
and lower real interest rates.<sup><a href="#f13">13</a></sup> In addition,
there is evidence that currency unions have very large positive effects
on trade.<sup><a href="#f14">14</a></sup>
</li><li> Floats, on the other hand, really do seem to have some of the insulating
properties that are traditionally attributed to them. Borensztein, Zettelmeyer
and Philippon (2001) find much smaller reactions in domestic interest
rates, to both U.S. interest rate shocks and shocks to emerging market
risk premia, for Singapore (managed float) than for Hong Kong (currency
board).<sup><a href="#f15">15</a></sup> A similar comparison between
Mexico and Argentina is not as clear cut; in particular, interest rates
in both countries seem to react to common shocks to emerging market
risk premia with about equal force. However, this is not easily attributable
to a "fear of floating" because the Mexican exchange rate also shows
a very large reaction to the same shocks.<sup><a href="#f16">16</a></sup> </li>
</ul>
In summary, intermediate regimes&#8212;including soft pegs, bands, and
crawling pegs&#8212;are unlikely to disappear, and they remain appropriate
for a wide range of developing countries without large exposure to international
capital flows, and as temporary regimes. When comparing soft pegs with
more flexible arrangements, the latter seem to do better on growth and
real volatility, while the former may be useful for stabilization purposes.
As permanent arrangements for emerging markets, however, the choice is
between floats and very hard pegs. How countries resolve this choice depends
on how they trade off the benefits of some monetary autonomy and perhaps
reduced real volatility on the one hand, and credibility, commitment,
and integration on the other.

<i>The last two decades have seen a proliferation of systemic banking
problems around the world. Banking crises have threatened macroeconomic
stability through their effects on monetary control, the fiscal consequences
of bank rescue packages, and the knock-on effects on capital outflows
and the external balance. Banking sector problems have quickly assumed
a prominent role in the IMF's operational work of surveillance and technical
assistance, and have often posed difficult challenges to the design and
implementation of IMF-supported programs. These developments have stimulated
a large body of IMF research.</i>
<BR><BR> Recent research at the IMF on banking sector distress encompasses a
variety of issues and methodologies. Some work remains close to operational
experience, and approaches policy questions in a pragmatic way, while
other work is more abstract, and arrives at policy recommendations through
modeling and econometric analysis. In the first category are several case
studies that review the causes and effects of banking crises and the policy
responses.<sup><a href="#ft1">1</a></sup> These papers show that, while
common elements are present, every banking crisis is different, and policymakers
will always have to deal with unexpected circumstances.
<BR><BR> Another group of studies asks more specific questions that can be addressed
through econometric analysis. Gonz&aacute;les-Hermosillo and others (1997)
study the determinants of the 1994 Mexican crisis using bank-level data.
Ramos (1998) and Schumacher (2000) explore the behavior of Argentine banks
during the Tequila episode.<sup><a href="#ft2">2</a></sup> An issue that
has received special attention is the "credit crunch," namely whether
the decline in bank credit observed after a crisis is due to bank financial
distress or to weak demand.<sup><a href="#ft3">3</a></sup> Using aggregate
data, Pazarba&#184;sioglu (1997) finds some evidence of a credit crunch
in Finland in 1991&#173;92, while Ghosh and Ghosh (1999) reject the hypothesis
for the recent Asian episodes. A negative result is also reported by Woo
(1999), who finds that the shortage of capital affected credit supply
in Japan only in one year. Using firm-level data for Korea, Borensztein
and Lee (2000) show that bank lending policies reflected financial distress
at the corporate level.
<BR><BR> While each banking crisis is unique, case studies often point to a number
of similar factors as proximate causes of distress. Cross-country econometric
studies of banking crises test which (if any) common factors can be identified.<sup><a href="#ft4">4</a></sup>
Using a multivariate logit econometric model, Demirg&uuml;&ccedil;-Kunt
and Detragiache (1998, 1999, 2000) find that low output growth, high interest
rates and inflation, and rapid credit expansion tend to be associated
with banking crises. Also, financial liberalization and generous deposit
insurance, when accompanied by poor institutions to regulate and supervise
banks, tend to contribute to fragility. Hussain and Wilhborg (1999), using
evidence from six Asian countries, show that bankruptcy procedures favoring
corporate debt restructuring lead to a speedier crisis resolution. Gonz&aacute;les-Hermosillo
(1999) integrates macroeconomic variables with bank-level data in a sample
consisting of three regions in the U.S., Mexico, and Colombia, and shows
that indicators of individual bank weakness are useful for predicting
systemwide crises.
<BR><BR> While most cross-country empirical papers focus on the determinants
of crises, Demirg&uuml;&ccedil;-Kunt and others (2000) study how the economy
and the banking sector are affected by distress.<sup><a href="#ft5">5</a></sup>
Using both macroeconomic and bank-level data, they find that depositor
runs are not a typical feature of banking crises, and that output growth
recovers quickly while credit remains depressed for a longer period of
time. Also, there is evidence that banks, even the healthier ones, reallocate
their asset portfolios away from loans and into safer assets.
<BR><BR> Research on banking crises at the IMF has also tackled a number of questions
at a theoretical level.<sup><a href="#ft6">6</a></sup> Inspired by the
Asian crises, Chan-Lau and Chen (1998) develop a model in which a small
change in fundamental variables may induce banks to stop monitoring their
customers, triggering a collapse in financial intermediation. Challenging
conventional wisdom, Cordella and Levy-Yeyati (1998, 1999) show that forcing
banks to disclose their risk exposure does not necessarily increase bank
stability, and that bank bailouts, by increasing bank charter value, may
reduce excessive risk-taking. Detragiache (1999) shows that, when the
bank deposit market becomes more integrated internationally but significant
barriers remain on the lending side, bank fragility will increase, and
the economy may be worse off. Huang and Xu (2000) analyze the conditions
under which the interbank market may break down, causing a systemic crisis,
while Goodhart and Huang (2000) develop a model of an international system
under a fixed exchange rate. They argue that although an international
interbank market can improve liquidity sharing among all the banks, it
also leads to international financial contagion, which can be contained
by an international lender of last resort.
<BR><BR> Policy responses to banking crises have also been a focus of IMF research.<sup><a href="#ft7">7</a></sup>
This work, which typically draws more from practical experience than from
theoretical or empirical results, has either offered general evaluations
of the set of policies available and the trade-offs involved, or focused
on specific policies. Among the latter, Woo (2000) evaluates asset management
companies versus decentralized corporate workouts, while Garcia (2000)
discusses the introduction of temporary blanket deposit guarantees during
a crisis.

V. Hugo Juan-Ram&oacute;n</font>
<BR><BR> <I>During the late
1980s and early 1990s Mexico enjoyed strong capital inflows in response to an
effective stabilization program, privatizations, structural reforms, and the
Brady Plan. In 1994, in reaction to an increase in interest rates abroad and
domestic political strife, capital began to flow out of the country and a financial
crisis erupted on December 20, 1994. In response, Mexico adopted a floating
exchange rate regime; prevented a collapse in the payments system; and implemented
reforms to the pension system, and to the banking, fiscal, and external sectors.
This article provides an overview of selected research conducted by the IMF
staff on Mexico since the time of the crisis.</I>
<BR><BR> What were the factors behind the Mexican financial crisis? This question constitutes
the theme of two papers&#8212;Savastano, Rold&oacute;s, and Santaella (1995);
and Masson and Ag&eacute;nor (1996).<SUP><a href="#cs1">1</a></SUP> The first
article discusses three complementary views of the crisis: the adverse shocks
view, the unsustainable external position view, and the policy-slippages view.
The second article, which concentrates on credibility, asserts that investors
appear to have seriously underestimated the risk of devaluation, despite early
warning signals. Similarly, other literature, such as &Ouml;tker and Pazarba&#184;sioglu
(1997) argue that the decline in foreign reserves and the increase in the share
of short-term, foreign-currency-indexed debt seem to be the main factors explaining
the timing of the Mexican crisis.<SUP><a href="#cs2">2</a></SUP>
<BR><BR> Kalter and Ribas (1999) analyze the Mexican crisis with a focus on the role
of expanding government operations, within the context of a quasi-fixed nominal
exchange rate, in reducing the relative price of traded goods.<SUP><a href="#cs3">3</a></SUP>
Increases in government expenditures and taxation is associated with increased
production costs, excess demand for nontraded goods, and a deterioration in
the financial health of the traded goods sector. Becker, Gelos, and Richards
(2000), using company-level data in Mexico during 1994&#173;95, find that although
interest rates failed to show a clear confidence loss in the exchange rate regime,
the relative performance of net exporters suggests that expectations of devaluation
increased continuously.<SUP><a href="#cs4">4</a></SUP>
<BR><BR> As Mexico changed its exchange rate/monetary policy strategy after the crisis,
IMF research shifted toward other key issues. Edwards and Savastano (1998) inquire
whether during 1995&#173;97 the peso-dollar exchange rate behaved in a manner
compatible with a floating exchange rate regime.<SUP><a href="#cs5">5</a></SUP>
Their econometric analysis suggests that Mexico's exchange rate behavior has
been largely consistent with that of (quasi) floating rates; and that during
that period the Bank of Mexico (BOM) took into account exchange rate developments
for conducting monetary policy.
<BR><BR> As for monetary policy, issues such as the duration of the lags from instruments
to targets, the main transmission mechanism, and the identification of shocks,
which had been absent from the Latin American debate, became relevant for Mexico.<SUP><a href="#cs6">6</a></SUP>
Juan-Ram&oacute;n (1996), and Aguilar and Juan-Ram&oacute;n (1997) analyze these
issues; they describe the daily conduct of monetary policy since September 1995
when the BOM started using a system of cumulative balances with commercial banks
as an operational target. Using daily data from September 1995 to December 1996,
both articles find that most liquidity shocks originated on the demand side,
and that the BOM signaled to the market its desired monetary policy stance by
announcing small changes in its operating target, which, in turn, promptly affected
short-term interest rates in the desired direction. Castellanos (2000), a researcher
at the BOM, using daily data from January 1996 to January 2000, confirms this
first channel of transmission but also finds some instability in interest rate
responses after June 1998.
<BR><BR> The sizable devaluation, the sharp increase in interest rates, and the abrupt
downturn of the economy in the aftermath of the crisis created serious liquidity
and solvency problems for the banking sector. IMF research indicated that the
Mexican banking crisis manifested on the asset side but did not cause a run
on the system's deposits; however, it did lead to a flight <I>from</I> quality.
Relatively sounder banks decided to reduce their cost of funding relative to
other banks, while problem banks increased their share of deposits because of
the higher interest rate paid and the government deposit guarantees. Developments
in the Mexican banking sector have been the subject of ongoing research at the
IMF. Gonz&aacute;lez-Hermosillo, Pazarba&#184;sioglu, and Billings (1997) use
the case of Mexico to show that bank-specific variables and contagion effects
explain the likelihood of bank failure, while macroeconomic variables largely
determine the timing of bank failures; and Gonz&aacute;lez-Hermosillo (1999)
empirically analyzes the contribution of microeconomic and macroeconomic factors
in five recent episodes of systemic banking problems, including Mexico in 1994&#173;95.<SUP><a href="#cs7">7</a></SUP>
<BR><BR> Even before the crisis, policymakers and IMF staff were concerned by the disappointing
performance of Mexico's per capita growth (see, e.g., Loser and Kalter, 1992).
IMF research concluded that Mexico would improve national growth by following
the well-established policy framework of macroeconomic stability, improving
human capital and the functioning of the judicial system, and deepening structural
reforms. Juan-Ram&oacute;n and Rivera-Bat&iacute;z (1996) analyze regional growth
and find convergence of real per capita GDP in Mexico's states and regions during
the periods of higher average national per capita growth (1970&#173;85), and
divergence during the lower-growth period (1985&#173;93).<SUP><a href="#cs8">8</a></SUP>
<BR><BR> The postcrisis resumption of capital inflows in Mexico has caused a market-driven
real appreciation of the peso, raising concerns about Mexico's external competitiveness.
In this connection, Dab&oacute;s and Juan-Ram&oacute;n (2000) study the long-run
behavior of the relative price of Mexican exports to nontraded goods. Gelos
and Werner (1999) study the role of financial liberalization, credit constraints,
and collateral in investment in the Mexican manufacturing sector; and Gelos
and Isgut (1999) examine capital adjustment patterns in the manufacturing sector
of Colombia and Mexico.<SUP><a href="#cs9">9</a></SUP>

<BR><BR> <b>Horst K&ouml;hler's </b>opening remarks asked whether decentralization
would enhance transparency and accountability at the local government
level and whether it would lead to poverty reduction and better macroeconomic
management. <b>Vito Tanzi</b> followed this by outlining the risks involved
in decentralization programs; he emphasized the appropriate sequencing
of measures so as to minimize risks.
<BR><BR> <b>Albert Breton</b> argued that intergovernmental competition must
be the primary economic rationale for decentralization. <b>Daniel Treisman's</b>
empirical analysis, however, did not find that competition between decentralized
jurisdictions either creates greater efficiency in governance or reduces
corruption. <b>Joachim von Braun</b> found that fiscal decentralization,
in itself, is unlikely to benefit the poor without prior, and effective,
political and administrative decentralization. In contrast, <b>Tugrul
Gurgur</b> and <b>Anwar Shah</b> found that decentralization supports
greater accountability and reduced corruption. <b>Michael Keen</b> pointed
out that increased corruption may not be a deciding factor against decentralization.
<BR><BR> <b>Paul Smoke</b> and <b>Giorgio Brosio </b>separately identified preconditions
for successful fiscal decentralization from diverse African experiences.
Viable local political mechanisms, sufficient local capacity, and access
to financial resources, including local tax revenues, are required. These
conditions are only weakly met in many African countries. <b>Ismail Momoniat</b>
stressed that effective budget management is also critical for success.
<BR><BR> In Asia, <b>Ehtisham Ahmad </b>and<b> Ali Mansoor</b> argued that the
absence of effective sequencing in the current, politically motivated
decentralization process in Indonesia poses risks not just to the decentralization
process, but to macroeconomic stability and interregional equity. <b>Govinda
Rao </b>showed that the more gradual decentralization in India has had
dangerous implications for the fiscal deficit. <b>Ke-Young Chu</b> pointed
to the importance of a proper evaluation of subnational finances in order
to understand macroeconomic prospects.
<BR><BR> In Latin America, <b>Jose Afonso </b>and <b>Luiz de Mello</b> described
the most recent fiscal decentralization reforms in Brazil, which have
concentrated on strengthening the role of municipalities in service delivery.
A Fiscal Responsibility Act has been instrumental in restoring subnational
fiscal discipline by limiting expenditures and borrowing. <b>Ernesto Rezk</b>
reviewed the Argentinean experience of decentralization which was damaged
by inappropriate borrowing by provincial governments. <b>Juan-Pablo Jimenez</b>
focused on the recent efforts in Argentina to implement a subnational
Fiscal Responsibility Law and a Program of Fiscal Adjustment and Financial
Restructuring. <b>Teresa Ter-Minassian</b> described some of the decentralization
issues that were featured in the IMF's recent policy discussions with
both Brazil and Argentina.
<BR><BR> <b>Martinez-Vasquez</b>, <b>John Norregaard</b>, and <b>Era Dabla-Norris
</b>focused on Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and <b>Jean-Jacques Dethier</b>
described the decentralization process in Hungary and Slovakia. These
countries tend to show unclear assignments of tax and expenditure responsibilities.
Problems include unfunded expenditure mandates and soft budget constraints
at the subnational level. <b>Alexei Lavrov</b>, <b>John Litwack</b>, and
<b>Douglas Sutherland </b>examined the necessary conditions to make decentralization
work in Russia. This assessment had clear parallels with the Chinese case
examined by <b>Ehtisham Ahmad, Li Keping</b>, and <b>Tom Richardson</b>.
Both papers argued for a centralization of social responsibilities, redefinition
of tax assignments, and a proper system of equalization transfers, with
lower administrations addressing truly local functions, such as education
and health care. <b>Christine Wallich</b> argued that the success of reforms
depends on three conditions&#8212;an effective central tax administration,
adequate fiscal resources, and local hard budget constraints. <b>Nicholas
Stern</b>, chief economist of the World Bank, agreed with this assessment.
<BR><BR> The European session included papers by <b>Piero Giarda</b> on Italy,
<b>Julio Vinuela</b> on Spain, and <b>Bernd Spahn </b>on Germany. They
showed that the extent of regional equalization is strongly influenced
by national characteristics, politics, and history. <b>Pierre Salmon</b>
addressed the scope of decentralization in the EU and suggested issues
that might be relevant in country and regional surveillance by the IMF.
<b>Pierre Pestieau </b>considered national redistribution policies.
<BR><BR> The concluding roundtable discussion among <b>Vito Tanzi, Ehtisham Ahmad,
Ismail Momoniat, Piero Giardia, and Robert Ebel </b>identified points
that would guide countries undertaking decentralization processes. Successful
systems need to foster transparency and accountability and have genuine
electoral competition. Wherever possible, the implementation of reform
programs should be gradual and carefully sequenced. The assignment of
function should follow the existence of capacity, and should precede the
assignment of revenues. Strong central government is needed to coordinate,
regulate, and monitor intergovernmental competition and to take responsibility
for equalization. Technical assistance from the IMF, World Bank, and other
donors is likely to be important for developing countries.

2000 featured papers on a number of important and topical themes. The
conference also commemorated an exciting period in the history of the
IMF's Research Department when two of its staff members, Robert Mundell
and Marcus Fleming, developed their famous and eponymous model. In an
after-dinner talk at the conference, Mundell shared some background surrounding
the development of the model during the 1960s, some influences that were
important, "and, yes, some of the defects of the model." In a presentation,
"International Macroeconomics: Beyond the Mundell-Fleming Model," Maurice
Obstfeld&#8212;delivering the first Mundell-Fleming lecture&#8212;discussed
how present research efforts have remedied some of those defects.</i>

<b>Interest Rate Response to Crises</b>
<br><br>During the 1997&#173;98 Asian crisis, Joseph Stiglitz and others urged
a reversal of the standard IMF prescription for a country facing a currency
crisis, that of raising interest rates temporarily to stem currency devaluation
and to restore financial stability. This group of economists argued that
raising interest rates would worsen the condition of corporate balance
sheets, thus, prompting further capital flight and weakening the currency.
Far from defending the currency, interest rate increases could instead
have the "perverse" impact of depreciating the exchange rate.
<BR><BR> Should this warning of a perverse impact be taken seriously? Several
papers at the conference addressed this question. For the Asian crisis
countries, <b>Atish Ghosh</b> and <b>Gabriela Basurto</b> found little
econometric evidence that increases in interest rates depreciate the exchange
rate, leading them to conclude that "the perverse effect . . . remains
a theoretical curiosum."
<BR><BR> The answer from theoretical models was less definitive. In the model
by <b>Philippe Aghion</b>, <b>Philippe Bacchetta</b>, and <b>Abhijit Banerjee</b>,
the main burden imposed by the financial crisis is that the devaluation
raises the foreign currency debt obligations of the corporate sector.
Consequently, limiting the depreciation through increases in interest
rates is, in most cases, good policy.
<BR><BR> <b>Lawrence Christiano</b>, <b>Chris Gust</b>, and <b>Jorge Roldos</b>
were more agnostic about whether or not interest rate increases are the
right policy in the face of a currency crisis. In their model, the burden
on the foreign currency debts may be overwhelmed by a rise in asset prices
(the asset side of the country's balance sheet). The response of asset
prices hinges, in turn, on the degree of substitutability and diminishing
returns in production. If the substitution between labor and imported
inputs is easy to make, interest rate cuts to maintain output may be a
good option. If the economy is unable to adjust factors that are complementary
to imported inputs&#8212;something that may be quite plausible in the short
run&#8212;then an interest rate cut could have a recessionary impact.
<BR><BR> <b>Impacts of IMF Lending</b>
<br><br>Critics of IMF lending to emerging markets during crises argue that
rescue packages foster "investor moral hazard." That is, investors are
willing to make more loans, and at better terms, to these countries than
they would otherwise make because they believe that the IMF will bail
out the countries (and, indirectly, the investors) in the event of a crisis.
<BR><BR> Detecting moral hazard is an empirical challenge. <b>Giovanni Dell'Ariccia</b>,
<b>Isabel Goedde,</b> and <b>Jeromin Zettelmeyer</b> suggest that the
Russian crisis of August 1998 provided an opportunity to observe this
effect. The widespread expectation by market participants that Russia
would receive a rescue package because it was "too nuclear to fail" turned
out to be wrong. The sign that the international community appeared less
willing to rescue emerging markets should have led investors to exercise
greater caution in lending to these markets, thereby raising emerging
market spreads and strengthening the link between spreads and economic
fundamentals. The authors found modest evidence that spreads did increase
in the aftermath of the Russian crisis; moreover, investors appear to
have started paying greater attention to countries' risks, as countries
with sounder economic policies experienced a smaller increase in spreads.
<BR><BR> Proponents of IMF lending argue that it has a "catalytic effect" in
overcoming asymmetric information or sovereign risk distortions that create
too little lending to some emerging markets. <b>Barry Eichengreen</b>
and <b>Ashoka Mody</b> reported some evidence of such an effect. Using
data on interest rate spreads for emerging market bonds issued over the
1990s, they found that IMF lending under the Extended Fund Facility programs
improves the terms of borrowing and market access to private lending.
In their empirical work, however, this effect appears to hold only for
countries with intermediate credit ratings.
<br><br><b>Engaging the Private Sector in Crisis Resolution</b>
<br><br>Exactly how to involve the private sector in crisis resolution is one
of the most difficult issues being tackled in international financial
architecture reforms. <b>Noriel Roubini</b> noted that there had been
important shifts in the language and tone of the discussions from the
coercive-sounding "bailing-in" of the private sector, to "burden-sharing,"
and, more recently, to "constructive engagement." The private sector involvement
(PSI) policies followed by the official sector have, to date, struck a
balance between the need to establish some rules&#8212;to reduce uncertainty
and unpredictability of policy&#8212;and the need for discretion to deal
with the particular circumstances of each country. Roubini noted that
while, over time, the buildup of these case histories might yield some
clear rules to be followed with regards to PSI, there will likely always
be a need for constructive ambiguity in the overall PSI framework.
<BR><BR> <b>Gabrielle Lipworth</b> and <b>Jens Nystedt</b> cautioned that, in
the absence of clearly established rules of the game concerning PSI, the
private sector will have a stronger incentive to seek new instruments
that are better insulated from restructurings. They noted that the large-scale
restructurings of syndicated bank loans in the aftermath of the 1980s
debt crisis had provided an impetus to the use of the international bond
market for emerging market borrowers. It would be natural to expect that
as bond restructurings become more common, private sector creditors will
try to use instruments, such as securitized or guaranteed debt, which
are harder to restructure.
<BR><BR> <b>Poverty, Inequality, and IFI Policies</b>
<br><br>There are few ailments of modern economies that have not been blamed,
at one time or another, on policies recommended by the international financial
institutions (IFIs). One steady refrain has been that structural adjustment
programs hurt the poor. <b>Bill Easterly</b>, however, found mixed evidence
on the issue. While the programs appear to shield the poor from some of
the pain of economic contractions, they also moderate the income gains
of the poor during economic expansions. This result may come about because
adjustment lending has greater impact on the formal sector than on the
informal sector, to which many of the poor tend to be attached. Hence,
"the poor may be ill-placed to take advantage of new opportunities created
by structural adjustment reforms," but they may also suffer less "from
the loss of old opportunities in sectors that were artificially protected
prior to reforms." The inclusion of provisions to strengthen social safety
nets in lending programs also cushions the impact of recessions on workers'
incomes.
<BR><BR> IFI lending and policy prescriptions are also often blamed for increasing
income inequality, particularly in transition economies that have undergone
tremendous economic change over the last decade. <b>Michael Keane</b>
and <b>Eswar Prasad</b>, however, challenged this conventional wisdom
for one of the more successful transition countries&#8212;Poland. Using
very comprehensive data on the incomes and consumption of Polish households,
they found that the increase in income inequality during the transition
was quite modest, leaving Poland with income inequality "closer to those
of Scandinavian countries than that of the United States." Though changes
in <i>income</i> inequality were modest, labor <i>earnings</i> inequality
did increase substantially during transition; however, government transfer
programs mitigated the rise in overall income inequality.
<BR><BR> <b>Effects of Exchange Rate Regimes</b>
<br><br>With countries increasingly experimenting with their choice of exchange
rate regimes, the issue of how regimes affect economic performance has
become even more critical. One immediate challenge for researchers is
how to classify a country's exchange rate regime, particularly because
there is often great divergence between a country's stated regime and
the one it follows in practice. The IMF provides a detailed classification
based on countries' stated regimes in its <i>Annual Report on Exchange
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions</i> (AREAER). <b>Eduardo Levy-Yeyati</b>
and <b>Federico Sturzenegger</b>, however, attempt an alternate classification
based on observed volatility in exchange rates&#8212;both in the level
of the exchange rate and in its rate of change&#8212;and the volatility
of reserves. To take an example, a country with low volatility of exchange
rates and high volatility of reserves is classified as a fixed exchange
rate regime, regardless of its declared regime.
<BR><BR> With this new classification, the authors find that intermediate exchange
rate regimes tend to have higher inflation rates (controlling for other
influences) than either fixed or floating exchange rate regimes. This
result is somewhat at odds with the findings of a comprehensive 1996 IMF
study by Ghosh, Gulde, Ostry, and Wolf.<sup>1</sup> Using a classification
of regimes based on the AREAER and input from IMF country experts, they
found fixed regimes to deliver lower inflation than other regimes. Other
results of the Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger study were that output growth
is lower, and output volatility higher, in countries with fixed exchange
rate regimes than in others with intermediate or floating regimes.
<BR><BR>Rupa Duttagupta and Antonio Spilimbergo tackled the puzzle of why exports of Asian crisis countries responded with a substantial lag to the large real depreciations of their currencies. They presented evidence that the near-simultaneous depreciationof these currencies neutralized the competitive advantage that any one country might have gained had its currency been the only one devalued.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR><b><font color="#004490"><a name="emerg"></a>Emerging Market Financing
Report</font></b>
<BR><BR> <i>As part of its surveillance of international financial markets, the
IMF began publishing a quarterly report on Emerging Market Financing (EMF)
in 2000. This report regularly reviews developments in emerging markets
and the outlook for capital flows to these markets, and it examines issues
related to the functioning of international capital markets. The latest
EMF report (fourth quarter, 2000) analyzes periodic bouts of contagion
across emerging markets and sporadic closures of emerging debt primary
markets.</i>
<BR><BR> Several effects collectively took a toll on emerging bond and equity
markets in the last quarter of 2000, including heightened expectations
of a slowdown in the U.S. economy; lowered earnings potential of the technology,
media, and telecommunications sectors; and a deterioration in U.S. credit
markets. As emerging market spreads widened sharply, tighter external
liquidity conditions focused investor attention on prospects for the two
largest emerging market borrowers in international bond markets&#8212;Argentina
and Turkey. Despite an almost complete drying up in bond issuance, total
emerging markets fundraising on international capital markets, nevertheless,
held up relatively well, supported by a surge in equity placements from
China and a robust syndicated loan market. For the year as a whole, fundraising
reached its second highest level, behind only the peak boom year of 1997.
<BR><BR> The outlook for emerging market assets and financing remains closely
tied to developments in the external environment. Changing expectations
of the relative probabilities of "soft" versus "hard" landing scenarios
for the United States are likely to keep markets volatile. The baseline
outlook for 2001 is for moderation in bond financing, selective equity
placements, and a supportive loan market.

<b>Ghana: Economic Development in a Democratic Environment</b> <br>
<i>Sergio Pereira Leite, Anthony Pellechio, Luisa Zanforlin, Girma Begashaw,<br>
Stefania Fabrizio, and Joachim Harnack</i>
<BR><BR> This study reviews main economic developments and policies in Ghana
during the 1992&#173;99 period and highlights the challenges and trade-offs
that a small open economy faces when developing in a democratic environment.
The paper underscores how a democratic and participatory approach to policymaking
can contribute to better decision making, broader popular support for
economic programs, and prevention of backtracking. But it also makes clear
that consensus building takes time and effort, and that, by itself, a
participatory approach does not ensure success. Ghana's <i>Vision 2020
</i>program was a good start, but it still falls short of what is needed
to achieve middle- income status within one generation. The next phase
of economic reforms should focus on the areas most likely to make a large
contribution to reducing poverty and raising sustainable growth, that
is, agricultural development, trade, public sector reforms, privatization,
and governance.

<b>Pension Reform in the Baltics: Issues and Prospects</b> <br>
<i>Jerald Schiff, Niko Hobdari, <br>
Axel Schimmelpfennig, and Roman Zytek</i>
<BR><BR> This paper summarizes efforts by the Baltic countries to reform their
pension systems, and examines the choices these countries face in their
continued reform efforts. Early in their transition, these countries enacted
measures that were aimed at correcting the flaws of the inherited Soviet
system, in particular, by shoring up the finances of the pension systems
and reducing their distortionary impacts. While these efforts were largely
successful, they have been partially undone in subsequent years.
<BR><BR> Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have recently turned their attention
to addressing adverse demographic trends, moving toward a three-pillar
pension system incorporating a fully-funded scheme. The paper emphasizes
that, while such pension reforms can have significant benefits, they do
not allow countries to "escape" problems associated with changing demographics.
Rather, reforms can help to address demographic concerns only to the extent
that they contribute to higher national savings and growth. In this context,
the details of the operations and financing of the fully funded scheme
are crucial.

</font></b> <b>Developments and Challenges in the Caribbean Region</b>
<br>
<i>Samuel Itam, Simon Cueva, Erik Lundback, Janet Stotsky, and Stephen
Tokarick</i>
<BR><BR> This study concludes that economic growth in the Caribbean region is
expected to increase over the medium term, averaging about 3.5 percent
a year during 2000&#173;05, compared with 2.6 percent during 1990&#173;99.
The inflation differential with the United States is also expected to
narrow, resulting in some gains in competitiveness for the region. However,
Caribbean countries face several tough challenges, as their preferential
trade arrangements with industrial countries are likely to be progressively
eroded and concessional assistance will become more difficult to attract.
A slowing U.S. economy could also adversely affect the region's foreign
currency earnings.
<BR><BR> The members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) will therefore need
to take a number of measures to preserve economic gains made over the
past two decades. These include accelerating privatization of state-owned
financial institutions, expanding trade liberalization, holding down local
production costs and diversifying exports. Reducing public sector deficits
will require a balanced combination of tax reform and spending restraint.
Progress toward achieving the goal of a single market economy in the Caribbean
region has been slow, but some success has been achieved in harmonizing
domestic tax regimes.

<b>Adopting Inflation Targeting: Practical Issues for<font color=#00614E><br>
</font>Emerging Market Countries</b> <br>
<i>Andrea Schaechter, Mark R. Stone, and Mark Zelmer</i>
<BR><BR> This paper assesses the institutional and operational practicalities
of inflation targeting for the increasing number of emerging market countries
that are adopting this type of regime. The motivation for the paper is
the increasing number of emerging market countries that are asking the
IMF for technical assistance in this area. The assessment draws largely
on the relatively long inflation-targeting experiences of certain industrial
countries, as well as the more recent experiences of some emerging market
countries. A comparison between the practices of emerging and industrial
countries suggests that the former tend to prefer more formal institutional
frameworks, shorter target horizons, target bands rather than points,
and more frequent foreign exchange market intervention. These distinctions
are largely attributable to differing economic structures and history&#8212;for
example, emerging market economies tend to be more prone to volatile capital
flows and other shocks, have less developed financial systems, and have
higher and more variable rates of inflation.

<b>Modern Banking and OTC Derivatives Markets:<br>
The Transformation of Global Finance and<br>
Its Implications for Systemic Risk</b> <br>
<i>Garry Schinasi, R. Sean Craig, Burkhard Drees, and <br>
Charles Kramer</i>
<BR><BR> This paper notes that the rapid growth, development, and widespread
use of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives have accompanied, and in many
ways made possible, the modernization of banking and the globalization
of finance. While acknowledging the considerable benefits that derivatives
have provided, the paper identifies and examines sources of risk to market
stability and imperfections in the underlying institutional and market
infrastructures.
<BR><BR> The authors propose a rebalancing of public and private roles in ensuring
stability in OTC derivatives markets. They argue that the potential for
instability can be reduced through more effective market discipline, improved
private risk management, greater public disclosure, and market transparency.
The authors also propose that public authorities become more proactive
in providing incentives for effective market discipline, and also consider
changes in prudential regulations&#8212;in particular, raising capital
adequacy requirements&#8212;if market discipline does not improve. More
effective monitoring of OTC derivatives markets and the removal of legal
and regulatory uncertainties are also called for.

Reform of Price Subsidies: A Guide for Policymakers</font></b> <br>
<font color="#000000">Sanjeev Gupta, Marijn Verhoeven, Robert Gillingham,
Christian Schiller, Ali Mansoor, and <br>
Juan Pablo Cordoba</font>
<BR><BR> Price-subsidy reform, when it is done well, can release resources for
social services, improve efficiency, and facilitate economic growth for
the poor. Price increases, however, can also result in income losses for
the poor and, in some cases, lead to political unrest. This guide draws
on the experiences in 28 countries to advise policymakers on how to design
price-subsidy reforms. It discusses economic and political considerations
and makes recommendations concerning the speed of reforms and social protection
mechanisms.
<BR><BR> The guide finds that large budgetary savings from price-subsidy reforms
are difficult to achieve in the short run and that rapid reform has been
the exception in the cases reviewed. Mechanisms for protecting the poor
should be established before reforms are initiated and should be temporary.
The risk of political disruption is highest when rapid reform is attempted
without social protection mechanisms and when the government is unpopular.
This risk can be minimized by distributing the initial burdens of reform
fairly and by clearly explaining the cost and benefits to the public.

Outlook, October 2000</b></font> <font color=#004490><br>
Summary by Maitland MacFarlan and Torsten Sl&oslash;k</font>
<BR><BR> The <A HREF="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2000/02/index.htm">October 2000 <i>World Economic Outlook</i></A> (WEO) states that global
growth in 2000 is expected to be the strongest it has been in over a decade,
with robust or strengthening economic activity in almost all regions of
the world. In 2001, although slowing, world growth is expected to remain
at a high level. Some important risks are mentioned too in the outlook,
including persistent imbalances in growth rates and current account positions
among the major currency areas, currency misalignments, generous stock
market valuations, and increases in oil prices.
<BR><BR> The WEO presents a more detailed look at recent productivity improvements
in the United States and in other countries in Chapter II, focusing on
the linkages with "new economy" features, stock market developments, and
the recovery of capital flows to emerging markets. The chapter highlights
the growing importance of the information technology sector and its association
with historically high price-earnings ratios in global stock markets,
greater volatility of equity prices, and stronger international linkages
of stock prices. Most signs of a new economy are in the United States,
but new economy features will almost certainly spread to other industrial
countries&#8212;albeit with uncertain speed and scope. Uncertainties of
a new economy also present challenges to policymakers, notably the difficulties
in identifying economic shocks and determining appropriate policy responses
when the productivity growth rate is both uncertain and changing. Included
in Chapter II is a review of recent developments in commodity prices,
noting the negative terms of trade shocks faced by many nonfuel-commodity-exporting
countries, and the particular difficulties these shocks have created for
poverty-stricken countries in Africa.
<BR><BR> Two other chapters of the WEO focus on the countries that have been
moving from centrally planned to more marketbased economic systems over
the past decade or so. Chapter III assesses the overall transition process
to date and the key policy lessons, including the experiences of China
and some other east Asian economies, while Chapter IV focuses on the prospective
enlargement of the European Union (EU) to include countries of Central
and Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Considering the transition process
as a whole, the WEO observes that many countries have made substantial
progress in achieving greater macroeconomic stability and introducing
essential structural and institutional reforms. Nevertheless, significant
differences are still apparent. Particularly striking is the much stronger
output growth among some Asian economies&#8212;China, Cambodia, the Lao
PDR, and Vietnam&#8212;compared with other transition economies in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union. The WEO concludes that the rapid growth
in east Asia largely reflected more favorable initial conditions such
as the relatively smaller role played by big, state-owned industrial enterprises
and a large agricultural sector, which boosted output and provided a pool
of surplus labor for new business. In other transition economies, large
state enterprises needed rapid reform and agricultural sectors tended
to be smaller.
<BR><BR> In general, the transition process outside of east Asia has proved to
be more difficult than expected, with output initially falling rapidly,
poverty increasing, and vested interests often slowing the implementation
of structural and institutional reforms. The overall better performance
of the EU accession countries reflects not just their more favorable starting
conditions, but also their stronger commitment to reforms&#8212;the latter
probably supported by accession requirements.
<BR><BR> A number of background studies were prepared by the IMF staff for the
October 2000 WEO: Tamim Bayoumi and Benjamin Hunt, "New Economy or Not:
What Should the Monetary Policymaker Believe?"; Beatrice Weder, "Institutional
Reform in Transition Economies; How Far Have They Come?"; Erik Berglof
and Gerard Roland, "From 'Regatta' to 'Big Bang'?: The Impact of the EU
Accession Strategy on Reform in Central and Eastern Europe"; and Mark
de Broeck and Torsten Sl&oslash;k, "Interpreting Real Exchange Rate Movements

<BR><BR> The research summaries in this issue provide an overview of research
done at the IMF on <i>exchange rate regimes</i> and <i>banking crises</i>.
Both topics are of considerable relevance to the member countries
of the IMF, including developing and industrial countries. These
summaries highlight a particular strength of IMF researchers: the
ability to discern common threads and to draw broader lessons from
careful analysis of the experiences of a diverse group of countries.
<BR><BR> Mexico is featured in this issue's <i>Country Study</i> and serves
as a prominent example of analytical work carried out on developing
countries by staff in the IMF's area departments.
<BR><BR> Two major conferences were held at the IMF during the last quarter
of 2000&#8212;the First Annual Research Conference and a Conference
on Fiscal Decentralization. Brief summaries of the proceedings of
both events are included in this bulletin.
<BR><BR> This issue also contains a description of the main themes of the
October 2000 <i>World Economic Outlook</i>.
