    on its own initiative or upon a motion by the Fund, decide summarily to dismiss
    the application if it is clearly inadmissible.</p>
  
<p>2. The Fund may file such a motion within thirty days of its receipt of

  <h3><a name="rule13">RULE XIII</a></h3>
  <h4>Oral Proceedings</h4>
  
<p>1. Oral proceedings shall be held if, on its own initiative or at the request
    of a party and following an opportunity for the opposing party to present
    its views pursuant to Rules VII - X, the Tribunal deems such proceedings
    useful. In such cases, the Tribunal shall hear the oral arguments of the
    parties and their counsel or representatives, and may examine them. In accordance
    with Article XII of the Statute, oral proceedings shall be open to all interested
    persons, unless the Tribunal decides that exceptional circumstances require
    that they be held in private.</p>
  
<p>2. At a time specified by the President, before the commencement of oral
    proceedings, each party shall inform the Registrar and, through him, the
    other parties, of the names and description of any witnesses and experts
    whom the party desires to be heard, indicating the points to which the evidence
    is to refer. The Tribunal may also call witnesses and experts.</p>
  
<p>3. The Tribunal shall decide on any application for the hearing of witnesses
    or experts and shall determine, in consultation with the parties or their
    counsel or representatives, the sequence of oral proceedings. Where a witness
    is not in a position to appear before the Tribunal, the Tribunal may decide
    that the witness shall reply in writing to the questions of the parties.
    The parties shall, however, retain the right to comment on any such written
    reply.</p>
  
<p>4. The parties or their counsel or representatives may, under the direction
    of the President, put questions to the witnesses and experts. The Tribunal
    may also examine witnesses and experts.</p>
  
    
<p>(a) Each witness shall make the following declaration before giving evidence:</p>
    
<p>&quot;I solemnly declare upon my honor and conscience that my testimony
      shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.&quot;</p>
    
<p>(b) Each expert shall make the following declaration before giving evidence:</p>
    
<p>&quot;I solemnly declare upon my honor and conscience that my testimony
      will be in accordance with my sincere belief.&quot;</p>
  
  
<p>5. The President is empowered to issue such orders and decide such matters
    as are necessary for the orderly disposition of cases, including ruling on
    objections raised concerning the examination of witnesses or the introduction
    of documentary evidence.</p>
  
<p>6. The Tribunal may limit oral proceedings to the oral arguments of the
    parties and their counsel or representatives where it considers the written
    evidentiary record to be adequate.</p>
  <h3><a name="rule14">RULE XIV</a></h3>
  <h4>Intervention</h4>
  
<p>1. Any person to whom the Tribunal is open under Article II, Section 1 of
    the Statute may, within thirty days of the issuance of the notice prescribed
    by Paragraph (f) of Rule IV (and, in exceptional circumstances, thereafter
    up until the closure of the written pleadings on petition to the President),
    apply to intervene in a case on the ground that he has a right which may
    be affected by the judgment to be given by the Tribunal. Such person shall
    for that purpose draw up and file an application to intervene in accordance
    with the conditions laid down in this Rule.</p>
  
<p>2. Rule VII, regarding the preparation and submission of an application
    shall apply <em>mutatis mutandis</em> to the application for intervention.</p>
  
<p>3. Upon ascertaining that the formal requirements of this Rule have been
    complied with, the Registrar shall transmit a copy of the application for
    intervention to the Applicant and to the Fund, each being entitled to present
    views on the issue of intervention within thirty days. At the request of
    a party or on his own initiative, the President may suspend the exchange
    of pleadings under Rules VII-X until the admissibility of the application
    for intervention has been decided. Upon expiration of the thirty-day period,
    whether or not the parties have replied, the Tribunal shall decide whether
    to grant the application to intervene. If the intervention is admitted, the
    intervenor shall thereafter participate in the proceedings as a party, and
    the schedule of pleadings shall be modified to accommodate his participation.</p>
  
<p>4. In the absence of an application for intervention, the Tribunal may invite
    the participation as an intervenor of any person to whom the Tribunal is
    open under Article II, Section 1 of the Statute and who has a right that
    may be affected by the judgment to be given by the Tribunal. The views of
    the Applicant and the Fund may be sought, in a manner consistent with Paragraph
    3 of this Rule, on the question of whether an individual should be invited
    to intervene. If the intervention is admitted, the intervenor shall thereafter
    participate in the proceedings as a party, and the schedule of pleadings
    shall be modified to accommodate his participation.</p>
  <h3><a name="rule15">RULE XV</a></h3>
  <h4>Amicus Curiae</h4>
  
<p>The Tribunal may, at its discretion, permit any person or persons, including
    the duly authorized representatives of the Staff Association, to communicate
    views to the Tribunal as <em>amici curiae</em>. The Tribunal may permit an <em>amicus
    curiae</em> access to the pleadings of the parties. The Tribunal shall enable
    the parties to submit timely observations on an <em>amicus</em> brief.</p>
  <h3><a name="rule16">RULE XVI</a></h3>
  <h4>Time Limits</h4>
  
<p>The calculation of time limits prescribed in these Rules of Procedure, all
    of which refer to calendar days, shall not include the day of the event from
    which the period runs, and shall include the next working day of the Fund
    when the last day of the period is not a working day. For the purpose of
    determining whether time limits have been met, the date of dispatch (whether
    by postal service or courier), when accompanied by proof thereof, shall be
    accepted as the date of filing the same as if the filing had been effected
    on that date by hand delivery to the Office of the Registrar. In exceptional
    circumstances, filing of pleadings by means other than postal service, courier
    or hand may be permitted by the Registrar in consultation with the President.</p>
  <h3><a name="rule17">RULE XVII</a></h3>
  <h4>Production of Documents</h4>
  
<p>1. The Applicant, pursuant to Rule VII, Paragraph 2(h), may request the
    Tribunal to order the production of documents or other evidence which he
    has requested and to which he has been denied access by the Fund. The request
    shall contain a statement of the Applicant's reasons supporting production
    accompanied by any documentation that bears upon the request. The Fund shall
    be given an opportunity to present its views on the matter to the Tribunal,
    pursuant to Rule VIII, Paragraph 5.</p>
  
<p>2. The Tribunal may reject the request if it finds that the documents or
    other evidence requested are irrelevant to the issues of the case, or that
    compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome or would infringe
    on the privacy of individuals. For purposes of deciding on the request, the
    Tribunal may examine <em>in camera</em> the documents requested.</p>
  
<p>3. The Tribunal may, subject to Article X, Section 1 of the Statute, order
    the production of documents or other evidence in the possession of the Fund,
    and may request information which it deems useful to its judgment, within
    a time period provided for in the order. The President may decide to suspend
    or extend time limits for pleadings to take account of a request for such
    an order.</p>
  <h3><a name="rule18">RULE XVIII</a></h3>
  <h4>Judgments</h4>
  
<p>1. In accordance with Article XIII of the Statute, all deliberations of
    the Tribunal shall be confidential. The judgment shall be adopted by majority
    vote.</p>
  
<p>2. Once the final text of the judgment has been approved and adopted, the
    judgment shall be signed by the President and the Registrar and shall contain
    the names of the members who have taken part in the decision.</p>
  
<p>3. Any member differing as to the grounds upon which the judgment was based
    or some of its conclusions, or dissenting from the judgment, may append a
    separate or dissenting opinion.</p>
  
<p>4. The judgment and any appended opinions shall be transmitted to the parties
    and to <em>amici curiae</em>. The Registrar shall notify the Fund community
    of the judgment and any appended opinions and shall arrange for their expeditious
    publication.</p>
  
<p>5. In accordance with Article XVII of the Statute, clerical and arithmetical
    errors in the judgment may be corrected by the Tribunal.</p>
  <h3><a name="rule19">RULE XIX</a></h3>
  <h4>Revision of Judgments</h4>
  
<p>1. In accordance with Article XVI of the Statute, a party may request revision
    of a judgment issued by the Tribunal, but only in the event that a fact or
    a document is discovered which by its nature might have had a decisive influence
    on the judgment of the Tribunal and which at the time of the judgment was
    unknown to the Tribunal and to the party to the case making application for
    the revision and such ignorance was not the responsibility of that party.</p>
  
<p>2. The revision must be requested within six months from the date on which
    the fact or document is discovered and, in any event, within one year from
    the date on which the party requesting the revision was notified of the judgment
    unless, upon request, the President sets another time limit.</p>
  
<p>3. The procedure set forth in Rules VII through XI shall be applied, <em>mutatis
      mutandis</em>, to the request for revision.</p>
  <h3><a name="rule20">RULE XX</a></h3>
  <h4>Interpretation of Judgments</h4>
  
<p>1. In accordance with Article XVII of the Statute, after a judgment has
    been rendered, a party may apply to the Tribunal requesting an interpretation
    of the operative provisions of the judgment.</p>
  
<p>2. The application shall be admissible only if it states with sufficient
    particularity in what respect the operative provisions of the judgment appear
    obscure or incomplete.</p>
  
<p>3. The Tribunal shall, after giving the other party or parties a reasonable
    opportunity to present its or their views on the matter, decide whether to
    admit the application for interpretation. If the application is admitted,
    the Tribunal shall issue its interpretation, which shall thereupon become
    part of the original judgment.</p>
  <h3><a name="rule21">RULE XXI</a></h3>
  <h4>Miscellaneous Provisions</h4>
  
<p>1. The President shall, in consultation with the other members of the Tribunal,
    fix the dates of the Tribunal's sessions.</p>
  
<p>2. The Tribunal, or, when the Tribunal is not in session, the President
    after consultation where appropriate with the members of the Tribunal may
    in exceptional cases modify the application of these Rules, including any
    time limits thereunder.</p>
  
<p>3. The Tribunal or, when the Tribunal is not in session, the President may
    deal with any matter not expressly provided for in the present Rules.</p>
  <h3><a name="rule22">RULE XXII</a></h3>

    the parties shall be given an opportunity to present their views to the Tribunal
    in response to a request for anonymity.</p>
  
<p>4. The Tribunal shall grant a request for anonymity where good cause has
    been shown for protecting the privacy of an individual.</p>
