<h1 class="h1Smaller">A Medium-Term Strategy for the IMF: Meeting the Challenge of Globalization</h1>
<small>By IMF Staff<br /><br /></small>

<div class="introParagraph">
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p>Twenty-first century globalization is presenting the global community  with new challenges. The IMF has an important role in fostering international cooperation  and helping individual countries to meet these challenges. But to do so it must remain  in step with a rapidly changing world. To this end, IMF Managing Director Rodrigo  de Rato launched a review in mid-2004 of the IMF&rsquo;s role, and presented a  <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/2005/eng/091505.pdf">medium-term strategy</a> to the IMF Annual Meetings in September 2005. In a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/040506.pdf">paper</a>, Mr. de Rato has now made specific proposals for implementing  this strategy, offering new directions in the IMF&rsquo;s policy advice to the  membership; an evolving role in emerging-market  countries; more effective engagement in low-income countries; and governance of  the Fund itself.</p></td></tr></table></div>
<p>Since its founding in 1944, the international  community has asked the IMF to continuously adapt its activities and operations  to handle a wide variety of new challenges: the  breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates; the oil crises  of the 1970s; the debt crisis of the 1980s; and the emerging-market crises of  the 1990s. Over the years, the collapse of the state-run economies of Eastern Europe and the challenges facing heavily indebted  poor countries have also prompted new directions for Fund assistance. </p>
<p>The  relatively benign economic and monetary conditions in the new century so far,  and the milestone of the IMF&rsquo;s 60th anniversary in 2004, have provided an opportunity to reflect on the state of  the institution and to look ahead. Some of the questions to consider at this  juncture include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Have the challenges of  the past decade pulled the Fund in too many directions, straining the original  vision of an institution devoted to international monetary stability and the  financing of temporary balance of payments problems? For example, the  emerging-market crises of the 1990s elicited major initiatives on <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/sc.htm">standards and codes</a>, <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/data.htm">data transparency</a>,  and <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/banking.htm">financial sector</a> assessments, while the response to 9/11 pushed the Fund into <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/aml.htm">combating the financing of terrorism and money  laundering</a>. The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/poor.htm">Fund&rsquo;s role in low-income  countries</a> has also expanded dramatically.</li>
  <li>Has the accumulation  of new <a href="../../../../pubs/ft/aa/index.html">mandates</a>, without  eliminating old ones, made it difficult to allocate resources effectively and  to stay ahead of emerging challenges?</li>
  <li>Is the Fund fully  prepared to meet the great macroeconomic challenges that lie ahead? These  include tackling unprecedented global imbalances, responding to capital account  crises caused by abrupt shifts in global asset allocations, and helping all  members, especially low-income countries, to grow by integrating into the world  economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Fund is to remain in step with a rapidly changing  world, it must identify an organizing principle that defines its mission and  prioritizes its elements. It must outline a strategy that explains how the Fund  might reorganize itself to meet its objectives with concrete actions and  outcomes for the next 3&ndash;5 years. Moreover, it must do so in a way that  addresses the concerns of the entire membership. </p>
<p>Upon  joining the institution in June 2004, IMF Managing Director <a href="../../../omd/bios/rrf.html">Rodrigo de Rato</a> launched a strategic  review to consider how best to redefine the role of the institution. A <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/2005/eng/091505.pdf">first report</a> on  this issue was published in September 2005, sparking a lively internal as well as public discussion  about the appropriate role of the institution and changes needed to discharge  that role effectively. Since then, much work has been done to  bring more precision to the ideas set out in that strategy. The priority has  now shifted to implementation, and a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/040506.pdf">new report </a>by the  Managing Director, to be considered by the IMFC at its spring meeting on April  22, makes specific proposals for moving ahead. </p>
<p>The  proposals put forward in the new report cover the following issues: </p>
<p><strong><em>1) </em></strong><strong><em>New  directions in <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/surv.htm">surveillance</a></em></strong>.  The difficulties in tackling unprecedented global imbalances and the challenges  facing individual countries underscore the need for stronger exercise of the  Fund&rsquo;s policy analysis and advice to its member countries, a process known as surveillance. </p>
<p>  At  the global level, this means doing more to identify&#8212;and promote effective  responses to&#8212;risks to economic stability, including from payments imbalances,  currency misalignments, and financial market disturbances. The Fund needs to sharpen  its advice to countries whose economies can have a regional or global impact,  especially where there are vulnerabilities that could affect world financial  markets. Specific proposals to make global surveillance more effective include:  (i) a new approach to multilateral consultation to facilitate discussions  within groups of countries on issues of systemic importance; (ii) broadening  the IMF&rsquo;s internal consultative group on exchange rates to all major emerging  market currencies; (iii) strengthening the analysis in the <em><a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/weorepts.htm">World Economic Outlook</a></em> and <em><a href="../../../../pubs/ft/gfsr/index.html">Global Financial Stability  Report</a></em> of macroeconomic risks and their interactions; and (iv)  formulating regional work plans, focusing on the main policy issues facing the  region.</p>
<p>  At  the country level, it means choosing focus and effectiveness over  comprehensiveness, with deeper analysis of financial systems, a multilateral  perspective to surveillance, and more regional context and outreach. Specific  proposals include: (i) elevating the coverage of financial sector issues in <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/country/index.htm">Article IV reports</a>; (ii) instituting  rolling multi-year surveillance agendas; (iii) streamlining Article IV reports  in alternate years for selected countries; and (iv) increasing the multilateral  dimension of Article IV surveillance through a strengthened focus on spillovers  and cross-country experience.</p>
<p><strong><em>2)  The changing role of the Fund in emerging market countries</em></strong>.  In the many countries that have already emerged to become major global players,  the main priority must be to augment candid and focused macroeconomic analysis  with enhanced surveillance over financial and capital markets. At the same  time, the Fund can do more by way of <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/globstab.htm">crisis prevention</a> and <a href="../../facts/crises.html">response</a>. </p>
<p>Specific  proposals for crisis prevention include: (i) clarifying the framework for  high-access Fund financing in situations other than capital account crises;  (ii) allowing for high-access contingent financing through a new instrument  available to countries with strong macroeconomic policies, sustainable debt,  and transparent reporting, but still facing potential balance sheet weaknesses  and vulnerabilities; and (iii) standing ready to support regional and other  reserve pooling arrangements, including by signaling sound policies. </p>
<p>Proposals  for crisis resolution deal with the complications of rare but important cases  of sovereign debt restructuring and arrears. The report reaffirms the basic  principle that an insistence on progress toward resolution of external payments  arrears as a condition for IMF lending remains appropriate. Beyond this, the  report (i) proposes that financing in debt restructuring cases should depend on  an agreed medium-term fiscal envelope and macroeconomic framework on which the  Fund expresses a clear view; and (ii) calls for a review of the good faith  criterion and related aspects of the lending-into-arrears policy. </p>
<p><strong><em>3)  More effective <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/poor.htm">engagement in low-income  countries</a></em></strong>. In recent years, great strides have  been made in contributing to economic development through <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/prsp.htm">poverty reduction strategies</a> and the <a href="../../facts/prgf.html">Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility</a>.  More flexible <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/howlend.htm">instruments of IMF support</a> have recently been introduced. The U.N. <a href="../../facts/mdg.html">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDGs), which  seek to halve key poverty indicators by 2015, are receiving much attention,  with the Fund and the World Bank called on to monitor and report on progress.  One of the challenges ahead will be to marshal the expected rise in aid flows,  including from debt relief, to achieve higher growth and the MDGs. Helping  countries do so requires a deeper but more focused engagement by the Fund,  including new understandings with the World Bank and other agencies on the  division of labor.</p>
<p>The Fund&rsquo;s strategy for low-income countries requires more  work in the following areas: (i) focus and flexibility&#8212;the Fund should focus on  macrocritical issues tailored to individual country circumstances, broaden its  division of labor with the World Bank, and offer more flexible lending  facilities; (ii) aid and the MDGs&#8212;the Fund needs to assess whether projected  aid flows are consistent with macroeconomic stability and the estimated costs  of achieving countries&rsquo; development goals, and also be more forthcoming with  donors; and (iii) <a href="../../facts/mdri.html">debt relief</a>&#8212;the  Fund needs to ensure that the beneficiaries of debt relief do not again  accumulate excessive debt. Countries&rsquo; public expenditure management systems  need to be strengthened. </p>
<p><strong><em>4) <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/glance.htm">Governance of the Fund</a></em></strong>.  Fair voice and distribution of <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/quotas.htm">quotas</a> are central  to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Fund. Emerging market and other  countries need to have a voice in the IMF commensurate with their weight in the  world economy. If political support for a two-stage approach emerges, the goal  of making concrete progress by the time of the Singapore Annual Meetings is  within reach. The first stage could involve ad hoc quota increases for  the most underrepresented members in the near term, followed by further steps  at a later stage. Agreement on an increase in basic votes, which is key for  strengthening the voice of the smallest members, could be part of either the  first or second phase. The Fund must also address other aspects of governance,  including transparent selection of management and better definition of the role  of the IMF Executive Board.</p>
<p><strong><em>5) <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/tech.htm">Capacity building</a></em></strong>.  Targeted efforts in this area are key to helping members implement reforms.  Capacity building also needs to be part of the strategy to address  vulnerabilities identified in surveillance. The Fund&rsquo;s efforts to build  macroeconomic institutions through technical assistance and training can be  strengthened with better prioritization and country ownership. </p>
<p><strong><em>6)  Streamlining</em></strong>. Action is needed to control procedure  and documentation, lest the work, messages, and governance of the institution be  lost in a sea of paper. Many specific proposals are being considered to enable  management and the Executive Board to shift attention from routine and detail  to broader  strategic  issues.</p>
<p><strong><em>7)  Medium-term budget</em></strong>. The overall approach of our strategy  can and must be reconciled within a medium-term budget that deals with the  projected fall in <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/finfac.htm">the Fund's income</a>.  But even with declining real spending, it is clear that a new business model is  needed to finance Fund activity in the future, with less reliance on margins  from lending and more on steady, long-term sources of income.</p>
<p>The  process of reflecting on a medium-term strategy for the Fund has extended for  nearly two years. The priority is now to move to implementation. After  consideration by the IMFC, the proposals&#8212;some of which can be implemented  quickly, others requiring further detailed work by staff, management and the Executive  Board&#8212;will be integrated with the work program of the IMF.</p>
