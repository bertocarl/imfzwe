        relations</i> 
      <p><b><i><a name="P51_3124"></a>Global governance, sovereign debt restructuring 
        set IMF-CSO agenda</i></b>
      <p>The IMF continued its vigorous and productive outreach with civil society 
        organizations in the last quarter of 2002, beginning with a major meeting 
        with global trade union leaders in October. Over 90 labor union leaders 
        from around the world met with IMF management and staff to discuss issues 
        ranging from the Fund's proposal to create a new framework for sovereign 
        debt restructuring, to improving global governance. 
      <p>The meeting covered many of the themes recurring in the IMF's interaction 
        with other civil society groups during late 2002. IMF staff participated 
        in two conferences organized by civil society organizations that debated 
        various aspects of global governance. At a conference organized by the 
        Montreal International Forum, IMF representatives discussed quotas and 
        voting systems, transparency, and the Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism 
        (SDRM). At a conference on globalization and global governance that was 
        held in Helsinki, the Director of the IMF's European offices argued that 
        reform of the IMF and the World Bank will not resolve all issues of global 
        governance. This is because many emerging market crises and the growing 
        gap between poor and rich countries can be traced to policy weaknesses 
        and governance problems in those countries themselves. To be sure, the 
        exchange of ideas on this important topic will continue in the future.
      <p>The IMF's work on poverty was discussed in various settings, including 
        at a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) conference in Almaty, Kazakhstan, 
        which debated recent progress in promoting economic growth and poverty 
        reduction in the CIS-7 countries. The Fund and the World Bank also continued 
        their efforts to improve poverty and social impact analysis, which could 
        become an important building block for the PRSP approach. At a conference 
        in Copenhagen organized by the European Network on Debt and Development 
        in November, IMF staff debated the challenges involved in reaching the 
        Millennium Development Goals. 
      <p>Finally, IMF missions and resident representatives continued their outreach 
        efforts in various parts of world. A few examples of this work is mentioned 
        under &quot;Country Notes.&quot;
      <p>We would like to thank each of you for the contributions you have made 
        to our work. We value your input and rely on your analysis. We look forward 
        to continuing our work together during the year ahead.

      <p><b><i><a name="P68_5586"></a>Management of IMF and World Bank meet with 
        global union leaders</i></b>
      <p>IMF and World Bank management and staff met with leaders of the international 
        labor movement in Washington, D.C. on October 21-23. The agenda focused 
        on issues of concern to labor unions, including poverty reduction, reform 
        of the international financial architecture, and ways to enhance the dialogue 
        between labor unions and the Bretton Woods institutions. The delegation 
        included over 90 labor union representatives from about 40 countries, 
        and was headed by Guy Ryder and Willy Thys, General Secretaries of the 
        International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World 
        Confederation of Labor (WCL), respectively. 
      <p><b>The current state of IMF cooperation with labor unions</b>
      <p>The Fund's relationship with labor unions has three elements: collaboration 
        with the International Labour Organization (ILO); mission and resident 
        representative contacts with country-level labor unions; and management 
        and staff contacts with international labor federations. With regard to 
        the last of these, in addition to the leadership meetings in Washington, 
        IMF staff has developed worldwide links through the labor federations 
        with national labor unions, and meets regularly with labor union leaders 
        through the confederations in Washington. Meetings with regional labor 
        confederations also take place, but on a more ad-hoc basis. 
      <p><b>Prospects for the world economy and the IMF's role</b>
      <p>In his introductory remarks, IMF Managing Director Horst K&ouml;hler 
        briefed the delegates about his recent meeting with the ILO's World Commission 
        on the Social Dimensions of Globalization and his contacts with labor 
        unions in Algeria and Mauritania during his recent trip to North Africa. 
        With regard to short-term economic prospects, he stressed the downside 
        risks to&#160;global growth and called for a collaborative approach to 
        help strengthen economic recovery. Such an approach ought to include the 
        elimination of trade-distorting practices by industrial countries, he 
        said, as these are detrimental to the growth in developing countries. 
        K&ouml;hler also referred to key reforms underway in the Fund, including 
        efforts to streamline Fund conditionality, strengthen the framework for 
        crisis prevention and resolution, and promote transparency and openness 
        on the part of both the Fund and its membership. 
      <p>In their response, labor representatives emphasized the likely negative 
        impact on workers of a downturn in the global economy. They were encouraged 
        by the dialogue between the Fund and the ILO Commission and noted that 
        it could help improve social peace and restore confidence in many crisis 
        countries. They were supportive of the Fund's commitment to strengthen 
        the dialogue with labor unions both at country and global levels. 
      <p><b>The IMF's crisis resolution framework</b>
      <p>Timothy Geithner, Director of the IMF Policy Development and Review Department, 
        spoke about the IMF's crisis resolution framework. The framework was strong, 
        he said, but to work effectively, it should be supported by appropriate 
        national economic policies and a stable external environment. Geithner 
        then presented his views on the Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism 
        (SDRM). 
      <p>Labor representatives indicated their broad support for the SDRM proposal, 
        but raised concerns similar to those of many other civil society organizations. 
        In particular, they noted that the initiative does not go far enough to 
        design a comprehensive legal framework modeled on domestic insolvency 
        regimes. They also noted that the SDRM should address the legality of 
        contracted debt, include official multilateral debt, and limit debt repayments 
        to a socially sustainable level. Furthermore, the IMF should play only 
        a limited role in the decision-making process. A few representatives thought 
        that sanctions should be included to force a return of flight capital 
        and that CSOs should be consulted on an equal footing with the international 
        financial community. 
      <p>Geithner stressed that the IMF provides resources that reduce the strain 
        on governments and make possible levels of social expenditure that would 
        not otherwise be sustainable. That is one of the reasons why its preferred 
        creditor status is central to the process. In domestic insolvency cases, 
        companies going through a workout often need access to new funds on preferred 
        terms so that they can maintain a minimum level of operations while they 
        reorganize. 
      <p>Geithner also warned participants about the potential impact of questioning 
        the legality of debt contracted by previous governments, as this might 
        affect sovereign lending in the future, including to countries that have 
        borrowed responsibly and are servicing their debts in a timely way. He 
        stressed that the revised framework does not anticipate a major role for 
        the Fund in initiating negotiations or arbitration (see below under &quot;further 
        reading&quot; for details). Moreover, there is no requirement for a Fund 
        program to be in place unless requested by the country. With respect to 
        the situation in Argentina, Geithner questioned whether sanctions would 
        lead to financial re-flows. The authorities should instead focus on creating 
        an economic environment that would encourage the return of funds. 
      <p>Lastly, Geithner noted that outreach activities are underway to encourage 
        further debate of the SDRM proposal. The Fund will continue to put the 
        development of its proposal before the public and give the international 
        community a more fully articulated SDRM design some time over the next 
        few months.
      <p><b>The case for standards and codes, and against a Tobin tax</b>
      <p>Mark Allen, Deputy Director of the Policy Development and Review Department, 
        explained how lessons from various crises continue to shape the IMF's 
        thinking about reforming the international financial architecture. He 
        noted in particular efforts to strengthen surveillance of countries, including 
        of their financial sectors, and steps to improve their transparency, such 
        as encouraging countries to adopt internationally recognized standards 
        and codes. Allen stressed that further work is needed to strengthen standards 
        in corporate governance and accounting, including in the major industrial 
        countries. 
      <p>Labor representatives said that the potential for global financial instability 
        has increased considerably with the continued world economic slowdown 
        and the crises in South America. They favored a move toward a more regulated 
        international financial system, including through capital controls. A 
        currency transactions tax (often called the Tobin tax) to reduce speculative 
        currency flows and raise money for poverty alleviation was also warranted.
      <p> 
      <p>In his response, Allen responded that there is no support in the Fund 
        for a Tobin tax approach for a number of reasons, including the fact that 
        it would not reduce the volatility of flows to emerging markets. It seemed 
        more important to address the excessive temptation to borrow that open 
        international capital markets can create: countries should have more effective 
        restraints on the amount of borrowing that they permit their governments, 
        banks and corporate sectors to undertake. Addressing the problem at the 
        source rather than by attempting to tax international flows was more promising, 
        Allen argued. Labor representatives indicated their willingness to continue 
        their research on this issue and said they looked forward to close cooperation 
        with the Fund. 
      <p><b>Global governance issues</b>
      <p>Reinhard&#160;Munzberg, Director of the IMF's UN Office, outlined the 
        various mechanisms for the Fund's cooperation with UN agencies, which 
        include the UN's Chief Executive Board for Coordination, the Social and 
        Economic Council, the Development Committee of the IMF and the World Bank 
        and the International Monetary and Financial Committee of the IMF. He 
        explained how the momentum generated by the WTO conference in Doha, and 
        the UN conferences in Monterrey and Johannesburg, has resulted in closer 
        cooperation between the UN system and the Bretton Woods institutions. 
        In particular, Monterrey was an example of effective multi-level cooperation 
        in which IMF staff contributed to discussions related to debt relief, 
        capacity building, and a &quot;two-pillar&quot; approach to development. 
        Thanks to initiatives like the Monterrey conference, the Fund is now better 
        informed about what other organizations are doing, and vice versa.
      <p>Labor representatives raised the issue of a global governance deficit 
        that has to be tackled in order to improve transparency and provide better 
        coherence in international policymaking. In this regard, they supported 
        the creation of a Global Economic and Social Council to oversee the interaction 
        of the various international institutions. 
      <p>In his response, Munzberg did not discount the need to discuss appropriate 
        global structures. However, he said the main emphasis should be for each 
        institution to focus on its responsibilities, particularly with regard 
        to the work needed to reach the Millennium Development Goals. 
      <p><b>Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers</b> 
      <p>Union representatives were also updated on IMF/World Bank work. Brian&#160;Ames, 
        an Advisor from the Policy Development and Review Department, and Sudhir 
        Shetty, a Sector Manager from the Poverty Reduction Group at the World 
        Bank, presented findings from the  <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/prspgen/review/2001/index.htm">PRSP 
        review</a> and most recent  <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/prspgen/2002/eng/091102.pdf">progress 
        report</a>. In particular, they highlighted the need to further promote 
        country ownership, increase transparency, prioritize expenditures, boost 
        capacity building, and institutionalize civil society participation. They 
        also noted the importance of Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) 
        to the PRSP process. 
      <p>Labor representatives were concerned about the level of participation 
        of local unions, and called upon the Fund to reject all PRSPs in which 
        labor did not participate. They also emphasized the need for &quot;alternative&quot; 
        approaches to macroeconomic and labor market reform policies in PRSPs. 
      <p>In his response,&#160;Ames stressed that PRSPs are country-owned documents, 
        and it is incumbent on national authorities to involve civil society in 
        the formulation of their poverty reduction strategies. He noted that there 
        may well be scope for alternative policy choices on issues related to 
        the pace and prioritization of privatization and the size of fiscal deficits 
        related to countries' unique circumstances (e.g., existing levels of debt). 
        However, it is a responsibility of civil society to propose alternative 
        and realistic approaches. 
      <p><b>Looking ahead: prospects for IMF cooperation with labor unions</b>
      <p>Deputy Division Chief Peter Fallon and Economist Nadeem Ilahi from the 
        Policy Development and Review Department presented the results of a recent 
        survey on consultation between the IMF and labor unions. The survey showed 
        that more meetings between IMF staff and labor unions are taking place 
        now than in the past at the country level, and that mission chiefs generally 
        are positive about these contacts. 
      <p>While labor representatives recognized that there has been progress, 
        they noted that in many countries these meetings still do not take place, 
        even when there are major labor market issues. They stressed that the 
        nature, frequency and substance of mission contacts with labor unions 
        will require further improvements and that staff should ensure that labor 
        union views are reflected in country reports.

      <p><b><i><a name="P121_16883"></a>IMF staff discuss global governance and 
        SDRM with civil society in Montreal </i></b> 
      <p>IMF staff participated in a conference on Global Governance in Montreal 
        on October&#160;13-16. The conference was organized by the Montreal International 
        Forum, which is a global alliance of individuals and organizations seeking 
        to increase the influence of civil society on the United Nations and other 
        multilateral institutions. 
      <p>The conference was attended by civil society representatives from all 
        continents, high-level UN officials, academics and various advocacy groups. 
        IMF staff participated as panelists in sessions devoted to &quot;Democratizing 
        Economic Global Governance: What Role for the UN and Civil Society vis-&agrave;-vis 
        the IFIs?&quot; and &quot;The Rise of Global Indebtedness and the Need 
        for an Insolvency Framework.&quot;
      <p><b>The Bretton Woods institutions and global governance</b>
      <p><br>
        In the discussion of global governance, participants wondered whether 
        the quota formulas employed by the Bretton Woods Institutions reflect 
        the relative economic positions of member countries. Many stressed the 
        difficulty of making any substantive changes in the representation of 
        developing countries on the IMF and World Bank Executive Boards and hence 
        in their governance, because of the de facto veto power of key members. 
        They asked whether different economic views were accommodated within the 
        Fund. 
      <p>In his presentation on governance, Bassirou Sarr, Advisor in the External 
        Relations Department, explained the workings of the IMF quota and voting 
        systems. He stressed that the IMF's preference for consensus in its decision 
        making actually aims to respect the interests and views of the developing 
        world in a way that any delineation of voting rights would not be able 
        to achieve. 
      <p>Sarr also noted the various reform initiatives now underway in the Fund, 
        in particular those related to enhancing transparency, and increasing 
        accountability and openness. He indicated that those efforts, as part 
        of the Monterrey process, aim to foster effective interaction with UN 
        agencies and enhance interaction with civil society.
      <p><b>The IMF's proposal for a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism</b>
      <p>Matthew Fisher, Assistant Director in the Policy Development and Review 
        Department, participated in the panel session on the Sovereign Debt Restructuring 
        Mechanism (SDRM). 
      <p>During the discussion, civil society organizations were generally supportive 
        of the establishment of a mechanism that could allow countries unable 
        to service their sovereign debt to declare a temporary debt payment standstill 
        and seek an orderly restructuring. But they also indicated that their 
        own preferred framework for international insolvency was different from 
        the one advocated by the IMF. They said an acceptable international insolvency 
        framework would adopt the key legal principles underlying all insolvency 
        resolution procedures. In addition, so-called illegitimate debt should 
        be disqualified from the restructuring, the IMF's preferred creditor status 
        should be abolished, and the Paris Club should be dissolved. Moreover, 
        analysis of debt sustainability should take into account parameters such 
        as the need to maintain social spending, and contingency clauses should 
        be included to take into account exogenous factors such as declines in 
        commodity prices. Finally, the UN-not the IMF-should have the central 
        role in the SDRM, and civil society organizations should continue to be 
        consulted while the framework is being developed. 
      <p>During his intervention, Fisher noted the more limited role that the 
        IMF is likely to play in the new version of the sovereign debt restructuring 
        framework. Fisher also invited participants to think through the consequences 
        of a radical change in the validity of creditor claims for the operation 
        of capital markets. He stressed that it was necessary to trade concerns 
        based on ethical considerations regarding certain types of debt, with 
        the likely impact on the ability of emerging market countries to mobilize 
        resources from private capital markets. Fisher also informed participants 
        of the outreach effort that the Fund will undertake with civil society 
        as it continues its work on an SDRM proposal. In the near term, the IMF 
        is planning a  <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/seminars/2003/sdrm/index.htm">workshop 
        and conference</a> on the SDRM on January 22 (see &quot;current and

      <p><b><i><a name="P157_28994"></a>IMF states its views on how to govern 
        the global economy</i></b>
      <p>Flemming Larsen, Director of the IMF's European offices, attended a conference 
        on globalization and global governance in Helsinki, Finland on December 
        2-4, 2002. Larsen participated in a panel discussion entitled &quot;How 
        to Govern the Global Economy?&quot; Other panelists included Ann Pettifor, 
        Director, Jubilee Research at the New Economics Foundation; Nitin Desai, 
        Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs at the United 
        Nations; and Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar, Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
        Malaysia.
      <p><b>The IMF and global governance</b>
      <p>The conference topics reflected concerns expressed by civil society representatives 
        at other recent conferences on global governance, including the perceived 
        unilateralist attitude of the United States. Of more direct relevance 
        to the IMF, speakers also addressed the perceived need for better management 
        of global economic and financial crises. A prevalent view seemed to be 
        that if only the IMF (like the World Bank and the WTO) were governed better, 
        and more democratically, it would not commit all the mistakes it is alleged 
        to commit, and the many crises could be either prevented or at least resolved 
        without the social costs that they currently entail. 
      <p>Larsen argued in his presentation that although there are certainly also 
        global governance problems (including for instance agricultural subsidies 
        and the failure to put into force the OECD's anti-bribery convention), 
        a key reason for the many emerging market crises and the growing gap between 
        poor and rich countries could be traced to policy weaknesses and governance 
        problems in those countries themselves. It was therefore hard to imagine 
        that any new global governance structure, or even a &quot;democratization&quot; 
        of the IMF along the lines proposed by some civil society representatives, 
        would obviate the need for countries to strengthen their fundamentals. 
      <p><b>The need for regulation of financial markets</b>
      <p>Larsen also responded to criticism by his co-panelist, Ann Pettifor. 
        He agreed with Pettifor that everything was not perfect and that markets, 
        and especially financial markets, needed to be regulated, as the Enron 
        scandal had demonstrated. However, he also noted that adopting Pettifor's 
        views in their totality would amount to a return to the government-dominated 
        economic and financial model and high inflation era of the 1970s-an economic 
        model that had been rejected in the vast majority of the world's democracies, 
        starting in her own country, the United Kingdom, and culminating with 
        the collapse of communism. Pettifor responded by acknowledging that markets 
        were necessary, but that governments needed to take control of the markets 
        rather than the other way round as at present. The two agreed on the need 
        for NGOs to work with national governments-as the debt reduction campaign 
        had so successfully demonstrated-rather than trying to bypass national 
        parliaments and governments.

      <p><b><i><a name="P173_32040"></a>Transparency at the IMF and the rights 
        of the public to seek information</i></b>
      <p>Andrew Puddephatt, Executive Director of the London-based NGO &quot;Article 
        XIX&quot; met with IMF staff on November 27 to discuss transparency at 
        the IMF. The IMF was represented by Deputy General Counsel William Holder 
        of the Legal Department, Deputy Division Chief Przemek Gajdeczka and Senior 
        Economist Robert Price of the Policy Development and Review Department, 
        and Advisor Roger Nord and Senior Public Affairs Officer Sabina Bhatia 
        of the External Relations Department. 
      <p>Article XIX has assisted several countries with the introduction of &quot;transparency 
        laws.&quot; However, it also focuses on international organizations, and 
        provided input to the World Bank's Policy on Information Disclosure in 
        2001.
      <p>Puddephatt criticized the IMF's transparency policy for &quot;failing 
        to fully guarantee the public's right to know in accordance with international 
        standards.&quot; In particular, he said that the Fund does not have an 
        independent review process that would allow the public to appeal against 
        an unfavorable decision regarding the release of information. He also 
        argued that the Fund should have process guarantees on its transparency 
        policy, e.g. time-bound decisions and written explanations for any refusal 
        to release information.
      <p>Holder disagreed with the contention that the public's right to access 
        information is based on a principle of international law, extending to 
        information held by international organizations, and that the Fund's policies 
        breached such a principle. He said the IMF is an international institution 
        that is governed by its Articles of Agreement, which have the status of 
        an international treaty, i.e. of international law. With respect to the 
        criticism that there was no independent review of refusals to disclose 
        information, the Fund was open to suggestions. He said there might be 
        merit in having an appeal process for cases where access to the IMF's 
        archives was denied. However, while the staff and management could make 
        recommendations, authority ultimately rests with the Executive Board. 
      <p>Puddephatt also expressed interest in proposals made in the most recent 
         <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/trans/2002/eng/052402.htm">staff 
        paper</a> on IMF transparency, but not adopted by the Executive Board. 
        These included a proposed move to presumed publication of Article IV staff 
        reports. At present, the decision whether to publish such reports rests 
        with the member country. 
      <p>In response, Holder explained that the IMF is trying to strike a balance 
        between the legitimate interest of the public for access to information 
        and the legitimate interest of Fund members for confidentiality. According 
        to its Articles of Agreement, the Fund can publicly express its views 
        on a member's policies only with the consent of the member (barring the 
        rarely used exception of Article XII, Section 8). Furthermore, the voluntary 
        system of encouraging publication through peer pressure has worked well 
        in making countries more transparent.

        <a name="P194_35455"></a>IMF, World Bank evaluate experience with Poverty 
        and Social Impact Analysis</i></b><br>
      <p>Many countries-including those preparing <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/poverty/strategies/index.htm">Poverty 
        Reduction Strategy Papers</a> (PRSPs)-are grappling with the need to evaluate 
        the impact of key policy reforms on the poor. Poverty and Social Impact 
        Analysis (PSIA) is intended to help policy makers and analysts in developing 
        countries, as well as representatives of donor agencies and civil society 
        organizations make better policy choices. 
      <p>Even though there is a long history of work in the area of social impact 
        analysis, there have been-and still are-weaknesses in its application 
        to government policy. These weaknesses reflect in large part the challenges 
        involved in conducting PSIA, which include data constraints (in many instances, 
        the data required to do a comprehensive analysis are not readily available); 
        analytical constraints (the impact of macroeconomic and structural reforms 
        cannot easily be analyzed at the microeconomic or household level); capacity 
        constraints (in poor countries, capacity to analyze policy is weak); and 
        time constraints (while the analyst may face difficult data and analytical 
        challenges, the policy maker is often under pressure to make fast policy 
        decisions). 
      <p>With the advent of the PRSP approach, the World Bank and the Fund have 
        intensified efforts to help countries improve their analysis of the impact 
        of proposed policies. As part of these efforts, the Fund, the World Bank, 
        and the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) held a PSIA 
        workshop in Washington, D.C., on October 15-17. The purpose of the workshop 
        was to discuss early experiences with a series of World Bank/DFID-sponsored 
        pilot studies. The findings will hopefully contribute to a more informed 
        dialogue on the impact of various policies on poverty and social conditions. 
      <p>The pilot studies included Armenia (water tariff reform); Chad (cotton 
        sector reform); Guyana (sugar, water, and bauxite sector reforms); Honduras 
        (electricity privatization); Indonesia (rice tariff reform); Malawi (agriculture 
        marketing reform); Mongolia (cashmere tariff reform); Mozambique (fuel 
        tax); Rwanda (the fiscal deficit); Pakistan (energy tariff reform); and 
        Uganda (export initiative).
      <p>Seventy country representatives, and researchers and staff from the Fund, 
        Bank, and DFID attended the workshop. On the final day, many CSO representatives 
        attended an open forum organized to brief the public about the outcome 
        of the workshop. 
      <p><br>
        <br>
        The workshop focused on the practical implications of undertaking PSIA 
        in a cross-section of countries covering a diverse set of reforms. These 
        were some of the findings: 
      <ul>
        <li> PSIA should be part of countries' budget process, systems for monitoring 
          poverty, and poverty reduction strategies, as well as the on-going public 
          policy dialogue. <br>
          <br>
        <li> An understanding of the country's political context is important 
          for PSIA. Although all policy decisions are ultimately political, 
          PSIA can contribute toward more evidence-based policy-making and therefore 
          a more informed public debate. <br>
          <br>
        <li> There is a need for closer coordination and better organization of 
          PSIA work carried out by donors. Currently, many reforms are implemented 
          without an understanding of the impact they will have on poverty and 
          on social conditions more generally. Until countries' capacity to carry 
          out their own PSIA has been strengthened, the World Bank and bilateral 
          donor agencies should play a lead role in financing and in carrying 
          out analysis of key policy reforms identified under national poverty 
          reduction strategies. Over the medium term, local capacity to carry 
          out PSIA must be strengthened. This work should involve not only governments, 
          but also academia, civil society, and donors.

      <p><b><i><a name="P212_40671"></a>Forum on CIS-7 poverty reduction initiative</i></b> 
      <p>The PRSP process in the CIS-7 countries is at a crossroads, participants 
        concluded at a CIS-7  <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/nb/2002/nb02124.htm">poverty 
        reduction strategies forum</a>&#160;in Almaty, Kazakhstan on December 
        9-13. Over 200 public officials and CSO representatives, as well as donor 
        representatives, attended the forum, the third in an annual series organized  
        as part of the  <a href="http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/eca/eca.nsf/General/F269F5FA7017062F85256B810078CE70?OpenDocument">CIS-7 
        Initiative</a>, launched in February 2002. 
      <p>The forum heard that all the CIS-7 countries-Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, 
        the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan-are now growing 
        after a decade of decline and stagnation. Several countries, like the 
        Kyrgyz Republic, have begun to see substantial poverty reduction, especially 
        in rural areas.
      <p>Most of the countries are well on the way to formulating full Poverty 
        Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) or have already completed them. Economic 
        growth provides an opportunity to reduce poverty, but it should be ensured 
        that growth reaches the majority of the population. In this connection, 
        delegates called for measures to encourage social inclusion, with policies 
        aimed at the needs of disadvantaged groups, including many children, women, 
        internally-displaced persons, and migrant workers.
      <p>Participants stressed that the PRSP needs to become part of the regular 
        business of government in the region and should not be seen as a document 
        prepared just to satisfy the demands of international donors. Civil society 
        representatives also urged that their specialized knowledge about local 
        conditions be used by governments and international institutions in policy 
        design. 
      <p>The CIS-7 Initiative is sponsored by the IMF, the Asian Development Bank, 
        the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. 
        It aims to reduce poverty, promote economic growth, and reduce debt to 
        sustainable levels in the seven low-income countries of the  Commonwealth 
        of Independent States. The CIS-7 Initiative was officially endorsed 
        at a  <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2002/pr0223.htm">ministerial&#160;meeting</a> 
        in Washington, D.C. in April 2002, when ministers adopted a statement 
        of principles and objectives. 
      <p>The forum was organized by the World Bank, the IMF, and the UNDP, with 
        financial support from the Swiss government. Previous forums in the series 
        were held in Moscow in 2000 and in Budapest in 2001. Organizers said regional 
        partnership events were also being developed, with the aim of improving 
        donor coordination and offering forums to resolve trade and other cross-border 
        disputes.&#160;

      <p>Brian Ames, Advisor in the IMF's Policy Development and Review Department, 
        participated on a panel discussion&#160;on the MDGs.&#160;Among other 
        things, Ames stressed that&#160;the key challenges that lie ahead include 
        the need&#160;to further open up the policy dialogue to alternative macro-economic 
        scenarios and policy choices and to ensure that the Poverty Reduction 
        Strategy Paper (PRSP) process drives the Poverty Reduction and Growth 
        Facility (PRGF) rather than the other way around. 
      <p>Wayne Camard, Senior Economist in the External Relations Department, 
        served as &quot;resource person&quot; for a workshop on how to make private 
        flows to developing countries more pro-poor, especially as official flows 
        seem unlikely to reach the levels needed to achieve the MDGs. Camard noted 
        that rapid employment growth, though not explicit in the MDGs, was needed 
        to achieve them. He warned that policies would need to be carefully formulated 
        to ensure that doors were not slammed on the poorest in order to protect 
        the urban middle classes in developing countries. This provoked a lively 
        discussion over how to strike a balance between the goals of promoting 
        employment and of protecting workers (and in some cases the state) from 
        the excesses of investors.

      <p><b><i><a name="P224_56228"></a>Sachs, Birdsall and others debate IMF 
        role in institution-building </i></b><br>
      <p>The IMF held a  <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2002/tr021108.htm">discussion</a> 
        in its Economic Forum series on November 8, entitled &quot;Promoting Better 
        National Institutions: The Role of the IMF&quot;. The panelists were <b>Guillermo 
        Ortiz </b>(Governor, Bank of Mexico), <b>Nancy Birdsall (</b>President, 
        Center for Global Development), <b>Jeffrey Frankel (</b>Professor of Economics, 
        Harvard University) and <b>Jeffrey Sachs (</b>Professor of Economics, 
        Columbia University). <b>Eduardo Aninat </b>(Deputy Managing Director, 
        IMF) was the chairman. 
      <p>In his presentation, Sachs said that macroeconomic policy will not be 
        sufficient to address the problems of &quot;dying societies&quot; in Southern 
        Africa. These countries need a much larger infusion of outside help than 
        is currently on offer.&#160;Sachs acknowledged that IMF Managing Director 
        Horst&#160;K&ouml;hler is delivering this message constantly, but said&#160;it 
        was not being acted upon. Nowhere was there a realistic assessment of 
        what is needed to make these countries' societies function.
      <p>Sachs also said the IMF has a &quot;dismal&quot; track record of&#160;promoting 
        economic progress in the world's poorest countries. If the IMF wants to 
        remain active in Africa it has to understand that macroeconomic policy 
        goals such as achieving fiscal balance and maintaining monetary discipline&#160;are 
        not the essence of the&#160;problems there. If the Fund tries to force 
        the issue of macroeconomics it will &quot;continue to fail&quot; in the 
        continent.
      <p>Up to now, Sachs said, the IMF's approach to the economic problems of 
        African countries has been to add up the contributions of a country's 
        donors, establish the total available, and then advise the country on 
        how to live within its means. Sachs said the international community should 
        take a different approach: it should determine what a country needs to 
        spend in order to reach&#160;the Millennium Development Goals. If the 
        country has insufficient resources, it should be the IMF's responsibility 
        to inform donors of the amounts they need to provide to close the financing 
        gap.
      <p>Birdsall spoke about the importance of the social contract in open economies, 
        and the role of fiscal policy in affecting income distribution. She also 
        told the forum she was a member of a commission that called for the Poverty 
        Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) to be moved from the IMF to the World 
        Bank. She said it is &quot;completely wacky&quot; for the Fund to run 
        the PRGF. The IMF's role toward national institutions should be to &quot;first, 
        do no harm,&quot; to intervene with transparency, and to link its actions 
        to effects.
      <p>Ortiz said it was as important to preserve institutions as it was to 
        create them, and the Fund should avoid any breakdown of institutions. 
        Ortiz said a tragedy of Argentina's situation was its institutional breakdown. 
      <p><br>
        Frankel said there were functions and responsibilities once considered 
        outside the Fund's and the Bank's purviews that were now inside. Although 
        there was a view that &quot;the IMF should have stuck to its knitting 
        but has now become imperialist,&quot; he believed the expansion in the 
        Fund's purview had been appropriate.

      <p>During an October-November 2002 mission to Georgia, IMF staff met with 
        representatives of civil society. 
      <p>In one session involving ten different CSOs, the goal was to get a sense 
        of how civil society views have been solicited by the drafters of Georgia's 
        poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), entitled the &quot;Poverty Reduction 
        and Economic Growth Program&quot;, and whether they thought the document 
        adequately reflected these inputs. 
      <p>In another session, the mission team met with the PRSP drafting committee, 
        which consisted entirely of representatives of various Georgian NGOs and 
        think tanks. The committee members described their public outreach and 
        information efforts, as well as the process by which they came to agreement 
        on the content of the PRSP.

      <p>An IMF mission met with several labor union leaders in Islamabad in mid-November 
        2002, who expressed interest in being involved in the preparation of Pakistan's 
        PRSP. To this effect, they provided the mission with background material 
        on labor issues and the observance of labor standards. The union leaders 
        called for economic reforms that would stimulate growth and job creation 
        and underscored the need for effective consultation with social partners 
        in formulating reforms, including privatization. The mission briefed the 
        labor union leaders on certain aspects of the PRSP process, and highlighted 
        the concessional terms attached to the Fund's financial assistance to 
        Pakistan under the PRGF.

      <p><b><i><a name="P254_61873"></a>IMF mission meets with CSO representatives 
        in Bolivia</i></b> 
      <p>In mid-November, an IMF staff team met CSO representatives in Bolivia 
        for a wide-ranging discussion of economic policy issues, framed in the 
        context of the Article IV discussions. The representatives were from the 
        Catholic Church (CARITAS), an organization of small producers, a social 
        action group (UNITAS), and the organization for social oversight over 
        government-financed anti-poverty programs. 
      <p>The CSOs are seeking to provide effective input into the design of public 
        policies for the poverty reduction strategy. In their view, this policy 
        dialogue can help avoid social unrest. They expressed interest in learning 
        more about the government's plans for a new national dialogue and revision 
        of the poverty reduction strategy in the course of 2003. (In early December, 
        these issues were discussed in a government-sponsored seminar.) 
      <p>The CSO representatives also stressed the need for adequate information 
        to carry out social oversight of local anti-poverty programs, as envisaged 
        in the National Dialogue Law of 2001. Some representatives also expressed 
        concern that large fiscal deficits over the last two years have caused 
        resources to be diverted to meet a rising debt service burden. Furthermore, 
        inefficient spending and governance problems are seen as obstacles to 
        fighting poverty.

      <p><b><i><a name="P263_63244"></a>IMF staff update CSOs on the Fund's work 
        in Nicaragua</i></b>
      <p>Deputy Division Chief Marco Pi&ntilde;&oacute;n of the Western Hemisphere 
        Department briefed seven NGOs on Nicaragua on November 20. 
      <p>Pi&ntilde;&oacute;n explained that Nicaragua became eligible for assistance 
        under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in December 2000, but has not yet reached 
        the completion point. To do so, it must implement the floating completion 
        point conditions, and its IMF program needs to be on track. He said that 
        Nicaragua could reach the HIPC completion point during the second half 
        of 2003. 
      <p>Pi&ntilde;&oacute;n noted that debt-related problems include: i) external 
        debt, currently $6.4 billion, and ii) internal debt, which is growing 
        rapidly. Some of the increase is due to a recent banking crisis. He said 
        significant fiscal adjustment is required to put Nicaragua on a path to 
        sustainable economic growth. 
      <p>A participant asked whether the IMF believes debt relief will be sufficient 
        to alleviate the plight of the poor. Pi&ntilde;&oacute;n said the agreed 
        program assumes that debt relief will result in additional poverty-related 
        spending. He added that NGOs can play a role in ensuring that the savings 
        go to poverty programs. 
      <p>Asked about privatization, Pi&ntilde;&oacute;n said that the decision 
        to privatize lies with Nicaragua. The IMF supports privatization if it 
        will help attract private capital, technology, and other important resources. 
        Another participant suggested corruption is a problem, because privatization 
        would make it more difficult to hold country officials accountable. Pi&ntilde;&oacute;n 
        acknowledged the concern and urged NGOs to continue highlighting cases 
        of corruption. A third participant asked for the IMF's view on tax reform. 
        Pi&ntilde;&oacute;n said that the IMF is not proposing new taxes. Rather, 
        it has advised the authorities that the best approach would be to expand 
        the tax base and eliminate loopholes. 
      <p>With respect to Nicaragua's PRSP, participants were concerned that not 
        enough outreach to CSOs is underway, and asked what the Fund is doing 
        to encourage more outreach. Pi&ntilde;&oacute;n said the Fund has been 
        urging Nicaragua to broaden civil society's role. 
      <p>The IMF's Executive Board approved a new three-year  <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2002/pr0253.htm">PRGF 
        program for Nicaragua</a> on December 5. Nicaragua was also granted 
        about US$ 2.5 million in additional interim assistance under the HIPC 
        Initiative. On December 12, the staffs of the World Bank and the IMF published 
        their  <a href="https://www.imf.org/External/NP/jsa/2002/nic/eng/111902.pdf">assessment</a> 
        of the government's annual PRSP progress report, which reviews progress 
        in implementing Nicaragua's poverty reduction strategy.

          at its Spring Meetings in April 2003. 
          <p>To this end, the Fund is inviting representatives from the financial
