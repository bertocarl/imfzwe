      <p align="center"><i><a name="1"></a>Recent Developments in IMF-CSO
          Relations</i>
      <p>In this issue of the <i>Civil Society Newsletter</i>, we offer an <a href="#2a">interview
          with Masood Ahmed</a>, who recently took a two-year leave of absence
          from his position as Deputy Director of the IMF Policy Development
          and Review Department, where he had played a leading role in the development
          of Fund policies toward low-income countries. He has joined the U.K.
          Department for International Development as Director General, Policy
          and International. The interview makes clear Masood's role in helping
          to define IMF policies in a wide range of areas. But it also makes
          clear that the work with poor countries will continue to evolve in
          his absence.</p>
      <p>One area in which this evolution is taking place involves the Fund's
        work on debt sustainability, the subject of a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2003/052303.htm">new
        paper</a> on which <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03115.htm">public
        comment</a> is being sought. That paper itself is part of a broader reassessment
        of the role of the IMF in low-income countries that will become an important
        part of our outreach in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Important progress has been made in recent months in developing a guide
        for IMF staff relations with civil society organizations (CSOs). As reported
        in the last <a href="../index.html">two editions
        of the <i>Newsletter</i></a>, Prof. Jan Aart Scholte, of the Centre for
        the Study of Globalization and Regionalization at the University of Warwick
        in the U.K., has been preparing a draft of the guide in consultation
        with both IMF staff and civil society representatives.</p>
      <p>The comments from both the Fund and CSOs, as might be expected, were
        wide ranging and thought provoking. Scholte has incorporated these comments
        into a revised draft, which he has sent to the IMF. Scholte plans also
        to provide a copy of the revised draft to the individuals and CSOs who
        reviewed the first version. IMF staff expect to prepare a final draft
        of the guide in the next few weeks, which can then be issued to staff.
        At the same time, the guide will be posted on the Fund's external website,
        with an invitation to the public to comment. We envisage that the guide
        will be revised, refined, and updated after a period in which it is used
        by Fund staff in the field. Future issues of the <i>Newsletter</i> will
        offer updates on the topic.</p>

      <p align="center"><i><a name="2"></a>Feature Article</i></p>
      <p><b><i><a name="2a"></a>An interview with Masood Ahmed</i></b></p>
      <p><i>Masood Ahmed, Deputy Director of the IMF Policy Development and Review
          Department since 2000, has been named to a two-year appointment as
          Director General, Policy and International of the U.K. Department for
          International Development. At the Fund, Ahmed has played a leading
          role on a range of issues related to low-income countries, including
          coordinating the implementation of the Poverty Reduction and Growth
          Facility (PRGF) and the development of the Poverty Reduction Strategy
          Papers (PRSP) approach. He has also been a high-profile spokesman for
          the Fund on matters related to poverty reduction. Before joining the
          IMF, Ahmed worked at the World Bank for 21 years, rising to Vice President
          in 1997. He spoke to the Civil Society Newsletter in late June, on
          his last day at the IMF. </i></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Q: To what extent have anti-poverty objectives become part of the
            IMF culture? </b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> Over the past three or four years there has been a much
          more direct focus on how the Fund can contribute to improving living
          standards of poor people, on how we can manage poverty and the social
          impact of policies that we recommend. Now most Fund mission chiefs
          working on low income countries think much more systematically about
          the impact on the poor of the policies and programs that a country
          is undertaking. </p>
        <p>While the quality of the analysis is still uneven, we want to make
          sure also that the analysis is feeding into the dialogue about policy
          choices and tradeoffs&#8212;that it is not simply about how you mitigate
          the effect of policies on the poor. It is a tool that needs to feed
          back into the policy dialogue, not simply a downstream calculation
          and mitigation process. I think that is still at an early stage.</p>
        <p><b>Q: What are the organizational results of this evolution in thinking
            at the IMF?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> The basic difference is that we have much greater clarity
          about what is expected of the Fund in this area. We have clearer expectations
          of what the key features of the PRGF ought to be. We have clearer rules
          on what the Fund's involvement in the PRSP process ought to be. We
          have a clearer sense of how the Fund should be working on conditionality
          in terms of streamlining and focusing that conditionality on our core
          areas. We have a clearer sense of how the Fund should be working with
          the World Bank. We have a better sense of how the Fund and the UN should
          support the Millennium Development Goals process. We have built a much
          stronger community of mission chiefs working on low-income countries.
          They meet regularly; they interact with each other to look at common
          issues. With partners outside the Fund, issues being discussed include:
          how does the focus on poverty and on the Millennium Development Goals
          change the way we do macroeconomic analysis? The Fund has been working
          on the latter issue with the World Bank, with the U.K. Department for
          International Development, with the Dutch government and others. We
          recently hosted a conference at the Fund of people working on this
          issue in different agencies, including academic institutions and civil
          society organizations.</p>
        <p><b>Q: What are some of the key tasks that remain?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>The challenge is to implement change at the country level,
          in the basic design of our programs, in the way in which those programs
          are developed and negotiated with our interlocutors in country authorities,
          in the way in which our mission chiefs and our resident representatives
          interact with other donor agencies and with civil society. We have
          the institutional policies and expectations; now we have to apply them
          systematically in our everyday work with member countries.</p>
        <p><b>Q: Are there new gauges by which progress in the struggle against
            poverty can be measured?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>We are working much more closely with the UN now on trying
          to define the indicators which will enable monitoring of progress toward
          the MDGs. We are working to define how the Fund can specifically contribute
          to this process and what should be the indicators by which we measure
          our own effectiveness. </p>
        <p><b>Q: In what part of the world is the redefinition of IMF anti-poverty
            policy most advanced?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> Africa is very much the center of all of this work. There
          is a lot of effort in the African Department of the IMF to build on
          the framework that has been developed over the last few years and to
          use it as an organizing mechanism for our work in countries. Obviously,
          in some cases it adds to the burden on already-strapped resources in
          the departments. But I don't think there is an alternative, because
          this is now the internationally accepted framework. The Fund is very
          much part of having helped to define it. </p>
        <p><b>Q: To what extent is the new doctrine of focusing on poverty institutionalized
            at other multilateral organizations?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>Over the past 10 years there has been a progressive increase
          in the focus on poverty issues in the work that multilateral organizations
          do. Specifically over the past four to five years, there has been a
          much greater attempt at organizing the assistance by multilateral institutions
          around the core objective of reducing poverty and meeting the Millennium
          Development Goals. Some instruments have helped increase the operational
          focus on the antipoverty goals in the multilateral institutions. These
          instruments are, at the national level, the concept of the Poverty
          Reduction Strategy Paper, which serves as a framework for organizing
          the country's own efforts around poverty reduction, and organizing
          donor assistance and development support around the same objective.
          The second instrument is, at the international level, the agreement
          around the Millennium Development Goals as reflected in the Monterrey
          Consensus. </p>
        <p><b>Q: In a global climate in which uncertainty dominates the economies
            of the big industrialized countries&#8212;is this uncertainty running
            stronger than commitments to support anti-poverty work?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>I'm heartened by what I see happening in a number of countries
          in following through on the commitment to increase aid. In the post-Monterrey
          period aid flows are supposed to increase substantially by 2006. The
          United States has come through with a big increase in aid, and also
          more of a renewed focus on how to make that aid more effective. The
          European Commission has made a commitment to increase aid. Individual
          countries within that community are taking action to deliver on that.
          I am also quite heartened by what I see happening on aid delivery mechanisms,
          which reflect a commitment to harmonize efforts, and reduce the costs
          of doing business for poor countries. </p>
        <p><b>Q: The issue of protectionism by industrialized countries has not
            been resolved.</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>But you see a growing awareness of the link between trade
          and agricultural issues and their impact on the poor. There is now
          far more press coverage of how subsidies for cotton farmers in the
          U.S. force West African cotton farmers&#8212;who are competitive&#8212;out
          of a job. The fact that these issues are being given the prominence
          that they are is important. The fact that so many people now can cite
          statistics about the one billion dollars a day in agricultural subsidies;
          about the fact that a European cow receives a larger daily contribution
          from European consumers&#8212;$2 a day&#8212;than the income of half
          the world's people. The fact that all of this is playing in the media
          means that people are becoming aware. That creates an inevitable process
          that leads to change. These changes are not going to be easy. They
          are not simply about handing out money. They are about structural changes,
          and structural changes in economies and societies are difficult, as
          developing countries have been trying to say for a&#160;long time. </p>
        <p><b>Q: Will your departure weaken the new emphasis on anti-poverty
            work at the Fund?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>Individuals make a difference, but institutions are much
          bigger than individuals. I hope that in the time that I have been here
          I have been able to contribute to providing some impetus to the way
          in which the Fund has developed. There are many people in the Fund
          who are now ready to take on this role. It is not a role that can or
          should be thought of as synonymous with an individual. In particular
          (Policy Development and Review Department Deputy Director) Mark Allen
          will bring new energy, new ideas, new perspectives for taking work
          on development issues forward. And I also look to coming back in two
          years time and seeing how, with this additional experience, I can contribute
          to the Fund's mission.</p>

      <p align="center"><i><a name="3"></a>Poverty</i></p>
      <p><b><i><a name="3a"></a>Paper on Debt Sustainability</i></b></p>
      <p>The IMF has <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03115.htm">invited public
          comment</a> on a paper about debt sustainability in low-income countries.
          The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2003/052303.htm">paper</a> is
          intended to help in devising a policy framework&#8212;under development
          in close consultation with the World Bank, official creditors and debtors&#8212;that
          would guide low-income countries in their borrowing practices.</p>
      <p>The debt-sustainability paper&#8212;and request for public comment&#8212;is
        part of a broader effort to define a policy framework for the Fund's
        work in low-income countries for the long-term. In the coming weeks,
        the IMF Board also will consider an issues paper on &quot;The Role of
        the Fund in Low-Income Countries Over the Medium Term&quot; that will
        begin to address many of the key issues related to how the Fund can support
        low-income countries and contribute to the global effort to achieve the
        Millennium Development Goals. That paper will be accompanied by a separate
        paper examining the impact of exogenous shocks (natural disasters, commodity
        price fluctuations etc.) on low-income countries. A major outreach effort
        that will include consultations with civil society is anticipated.</p>
      <p>The issuance of the debt sustainability paper was preceded by <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2003/070903.pdf">three

      <p><b><i><a name="4a"></a>Managing Director K&ouml;hler meets African
            leaders</i></b></p>
      <p>IMF Managing Director Horst <a name="P123_13176"></a>K&ouml;hler <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03111.htm">conducted
          a four-country tour</a> of Africa July 6-11 as part of his ongoing
          effort to consult actively with key policymakers in the region on issues
          related to poverty reduction and the promotion of long-term economic
          growth.</p>
      <p>The Managing Director's visit took him to Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar
        and Mozambique, where he also participated in the summit of the Heads
        of State of the African Union. It was Mr. K&ouml;hler's fourth trip to
        sub-Saharan Africa since assuming office in 2000. </p>
      <p>In his <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2003/071003.htm">address</a> to
        the Heads of State, the Managing Director offered a firm commitment to
        provide Africa with the expertise and financing to help make significant
        progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals, which call
        for a halving of poverty between 1990 and 2015. He restated his call
        for the developed countries to meet their commitments to offer aid and
        trade opportunities to Africa, and he encouraged African leaders to take
        steps to enhance governance, sustain growth, encourage private investment,
        and promote regional cooperation.</p>
      <p>In Ethiopia, he reiterated Fund support for the government's economic
        policies and was able to obtain a first-hand view of the responses to
        the economic and social challenges created by the current drought, which
        has made food insecurity the Ethiopian government's top priority. He
        also met with about 140 members of civil society, including representatives
        of NGOs, labor unions and the private sector. Two topics figured in all
        meetings&#8212;the country's Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction
        Program, and the role of the private sector in economic development.
        The Ethiopian news agency ENA reported that Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
        said after his meeting with the Managing Director that Ethiopia and the
        IMF are working together &quot;with a great sense of cooperation and
        understanding on various issues.&quot; Mr. Meles said that while there
        are points of divergence on some issues, Ethiopia has forged a sound
        relationship with international financial institutions.</p>
      <p>In Kenya, Mr. K&ouml;hler met President Mwai Kibaki, his finance and
        economy team, and the leader of the parliamentary opposition. The Managing
        Director expressed his support for the government's strategy. He cited
        its fiscal prudence, its expenditure restructuring in favor of health
        and education programs, and its anticorruption measures. </p>
      <p>In Madagascar, Mr. K&ouml;hler met with President Marc Ravalomanana,
        Prime Minister Jacques Sylla, and members of the government. The Managing
        Director said he was pleased with the recent completion of Madagascar's
        Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which benefited from wide consultation
        among different groups, including civil society.</p>
      <p>In Mozambique, he met with President Joachim Chissano, several key members
        of the government and representatives of the private sector. He commended
        President Chissano on Mozambique's progress in improving economic policies
        and social conditions.</p>

      <p align="center"><i><a name="5"></a>Technical Assistance</i></p>
      <p><b><i><a name="5a"></a>AFRITAC moves West</i></b></p>
      <p>The IMF has expanded the territory covered by its centers to promote
        capacity-building in Africa. The West Africa Regional Technical Assistance
        Center (<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr0375.htm">West AFRITAC</a>)
        was opened in May in Bamako, Mali, to cover ten francophone countries
        in sub-Saharan Africa. Its inauguration follows the opening of an <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2002/pr0249.htm">East
        Africa counterpart</a>, which began operations last year in Dar es Salaam,
        Tanzania</p>
      <p>Technical Assistance is a familiar part of the development lexicon.
        But in the AFRITAC context, the term has a particular meaning. The centers'
        basic mission is to strengthen the ability of governments to design and
        carry out their own pro-growth poverty-reduction plans. These are set
        out in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, which have become the basic
        tool by which countries set out their development ideas.</p>
      <p>Through the AFRITACs, teams of resident experts, supplemented by short-term
        specialists, provide assistance in the core specialties of the IMF. Among
        the topics: macroeconomic policy, microfinancing, financial sector policies,
        tax policy and revenue administration, exchange rate administration,
        public spending management and macroeconomics statistics. </p>
      <p>The West AFRITAC is part of the IMF's response to calls by African leaders,
        including those expressed under the New Partnership for Africa's Development
        (NEPAD). The initiative builds on efforts by officials of the countries
        in its territory, the African Capacity Building Foundation, the African
        Development Bank and the <i>Banque Centrale des &Eacute;tats de L'Afrique
        de l'Ouest </i>(Central Bank of West African States).</p>
      <p>Many AFRITAC projects will strengthen capacity-building programs already
        under way. Among the examples: In Mali, the authorities are fortifying
        tax administration and public spending management, as well as employing
        a new budget classification system to monitor poverty-reducing spending.
        Benin and Niger are building capacity in tax administration and public
        expenditure management. And Guinea is showing progress in improving the
        country's statistical database and setting up a computerized budget monitoring
        system.</p>
      <p>If the two centers establish successful track records, three more centers
        could be established, which would allow all sub-Saharan countries to
        participate in the most up-to-date form of technical assistance available
        in the developing world. </p>

      <p><b><i><a name="6"></a>New pamphlet explains IMF's Technical Assistance
            work</i></b></p>
      <p>The IMF's work in the area of technical assistance is explained in a
        new publication, &quot;IMF Technical Assistance: Transferring Knowledge
        and Best Practice. The 56-page pamphlet explains technical assistance
        partly through case studies from around the world. </p>
      <p>Examples include capacity building in Africa; the fight against money
        laundering; assistance to central banks in Lithuania and Poland; advice
        on tax reform; the strengthening of trade policy; and assistance in setting
        up treasuries in transition economies. The IMF's work in post-conflict
        situations is highlighted with a first-person account of the rebuilding
        of economic institutions in Bosnia and Kosovo, as well as examples from
        Afghanistan and Timor Leste.</p>
      <p>The pamphlet also explains how the training programs of the IMF Institute
        complement technical assistance work. &quot;Providing technical assistance
        to member countries&#8212;particularly developing countries and countries
        in transition&#8212;is among the IMF's most important jobs. Yet this
        major component of our work is relatively unknown to the public at large,&quot; Eduardo
        Aninat, former IMF Deputy Managing Director responsible for technical
        assistance, writes in a forward. &quot;It plays a vital role in laying
        foundations for stronger economies and for a better future for the people
        of many countries of the world.&quot; </p>
      <p>Aimed at the general public, the pamphlet is free. The English and French
        versions have recently been published, and versions in Spanish and Arabic
        will be available shortly. Russian and Chinese versions are expected
        in September. </p>

      <p><b><i><a name="7a"></a>Putting NGOs in the mix</i></b></p>
      <p><b><i>Robert P. Hagemann, Resident Representative, Cambodia</i></b></p>
      <p>I recently launched an initiative to spark dialogue with the NGO community
        in Cambodia through a series of roundtable discussions. The interaction
        grew out of the Fund's interest, in the context of PRSP discussions,
        to hear civil society's views of policies to speed up and sustain poverty
        reduction in Cambodia. </p>
      <p>The first roundtable was held on June 19, 2003, in Phnom Penh, with
        representatives from international and Cambodian NGOs who had been invited
        to discuss revenue policies. The session began with a presentation on
        Cambodia's fiscal situation, the scale of the revenue challenge and,
        in particular, the policy and administrative reforms to boost revenue
        performance. The subsequent discussion brought a surprise: despite the
        availability of documentation on the program in Cambodia, participants
        knew little about extensive efforts to broaden the country's revenue
        base. </p>
      <p>They welcomed the initiative. Representatives seemed especially pleased
        about the &quot;fairness&quot; aspect of revenue work&#8212;that improving
        compliance and broadening coverage is aimed at improving equity. Specific
        proposals made by the NGO representatives included introduction of a
        progressive land tax to discourage land speculation; tax reductions on
        agricultural inputs to improve agricultural competitiveness and help
        diversify production; and the reduction or elimination of various fees
        collected at the provincial level (which by one estimate reach 70 percent
        of the price of products at delivery) to reduce disincentives to rural
        entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>Several topics for future discussion were identified: the budget formulation
        process; expenditure policies; conditionality under the PRGF; trade policy
        and WTO accession; and governance. The next roundtable was scheduled
        for July 16, 2003, for a discussion of governance and corruption.</p>

      <p><b><i><a name="7b"></a>Honduras: Macro lessons from Microfinance</i></b></p>
      <p><b><i>Francisco Vazquez, Economist, Monetary and Financial Systems Department</i></b></p>
      <p>Can a microfinance experiment provide lessons for macroeconomic and
        financial stability? For Honduras, the answer is a yes. Fund staff had
        the chance to hear directly from farmers about the benefits of &quot;<i>Monedero
        Banadesa</i>&quot;, a new microfinance project that provides credit to
        the owners of small farms. The meetings were held last February as part
        of a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fsap/fsap.asp">Financial System Assessment
        Program (FSAP)</a> that gauged the soundness of the country's financial
        system. </p>
      <p><i>Monedero Banadesa </i>is a successful approach to agricultural credit.
        The program, targeted at the smallest farmers, not only provides financing
        but, most importantly, also offers mandatory crop insurance. In an economy
        that depends on a few agricultural commodities, crop insurance is a major
        public policy issue. Falling farm commodity prices hit all farmers, causing
        problems throughout the economy and financial system. Knowing this, no
        individual farmer has an incentive to obtain insurance, anticipating
        that a mass of claims could cause insolvency throughout the insurance
        industry, which would require a government bailout. Therefore, policymakers
        are looking for alternative ways to ensure that individual farmers are
        properly protected against shocks.</p>
      <p>The <i>Monedero Banadesa </i>experiment is still in its early stages,
        and time will reveal aspects that need improvement. But the mission from
        the Monetary and Financial Systems Department learned from Hondurans
        how grassroots solutions can be applied at the macroeconomic level.</p>

      <p><b><i><a name="8"></a>A roundup of recent Western Hemisphere
            Department contacts with civil society</i></b></p>
      <p>Edited by Leonardo Cardemil, Advisor, Western Hemisphere Department</p>
      <p>In <b>Dominica</b>, staff met with news media and with a wide range
        of civil society representatives, including labor union officials, to
        gauge public support for a Fund-supported program that is being negotiated.
        Discussions centered on how to design policies that would move the economy
        forward. Civil society members consulted included staff of the &quot;Integrated
        Development Plan,&quot; an organization with civil society representation.</p>
      <p>An Article IV mission to the <b>Dominican Republic </b>to evaluate and
        discuss the state of the economy and financial system in February included
        discussions with key business and labor groupings. Meeting with members
        the National Council of Private Enterprises (CONEP) and the National
        Council of Labor Unions, staff explained the aims of IMF surveillance.
        Specific issues included the role of fiscal discipline in limiting inflation,
        the power of free trade to produce more jobs and lower prices; and the
        need to avoid over-reliance on public sector employment, which can divert
        resources from priority social spending. Union activists agreed that
        public sector employment was inflated, though they were skeptical of
        the promised benefits of free trade, putting more emphasis on the potential
        for job loss. Private sector representatives urged staff to advise the
        government to tighten fiscal controls. They also advocated a Fund program.</p>
      <p>In <b>Ecuador, </b>a staff visit undertaken for a one-year review of
        the Stand-By Arrangement included meetings with national and foreign
        CSOs. These included representatives of the indigenous community, Jubilee
        2000, a UN-sponsored Fiscal Transparency Forum, and private sector associations.
        Talks centered on economic and social policies aimed at establishing
        sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, as well as the impact
        of debt obligations. First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger joined
        staff for part of the trip, visiting Quito and Guayaquil for discussions
        with indigenous and business-sector associations. Follow-up discussions
        included talks with academics and religious leaders on environmental
        concerns and debt problems in light of Ecuador's high poverty rate.</p>
      <p>In <b>Nicaragua, </b>Resident Representative Luis Breuer held a series
        of meetings with civil society organizations. Participants included the
        Papal Nuncio, Cardinal Miguel Obando y&#160;Bravo, as well as members
        of Quakers International (QI) and of the Civil Society Coordinating Council
        (CC&#8212;<i>Coordinadora Civil)</i>, an umbrella organization. Discussions
        focused on the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF), as well as CC
        complaints about perceived lack of transparency in the government's negotiating
        practices. QI members argued for assignment of debt relief gains to domestic
        social programs. Mr. Breuer responded that a&#160;large part of the debt
        relief is associated with only nominal (legal) debt reduction and does
        not represent cash savings that could be channeled to social programs.
        However, savings derived from the interim assistance that Nicaragua currently
        receives under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative&#8212;which
        represents reductions in actual service payments to the IFIs and other
        donors&#8212;were being channeled into social programs, under Fund and
        World Bank monitoring.</p>
