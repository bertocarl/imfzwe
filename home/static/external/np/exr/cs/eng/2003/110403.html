<p align="center"><i><a name="1"></a>Recent Developments in IMF-CSO 
Relations</i> 
<p>This issue of the Civil Society Newsletter comes at a time 
of considerable debate about economic development strategies. 
The effort to achieve a new global agreement on trade encountered 
serious obstacles at the World Trade Organization Ministerial 
in Canc&uacute;n, Mexico, in September, posing a new challenge 
to the international community. And recent political events in 
Latin America have raised again questions about appropriate economic 
strategies. At the same time, some economic gains have been made 
by many developing countries on all continents, creating an opportunity 
for the Fund to explore how it can make the best contribution 
to long term development and progress toward the Millennium Development 
Goals.<br>
<br>
Many of these issues were at the forefront of the discussions 
that took place at the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank 
in Dubai during September. The Fund's ministerial-level International 
Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) directly addressed the 
failure in Canc&uacute;n, re-asserting a worldwide commitment 
to the multilateral trading system, and also examined strategies 
for helping the developing world (see <a href="#3">article on 
IMFC communiqu&eacute;</a>). IMF Managing Director Horst K&ouml;hler 
also examined these issues in his keynote <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2003/092303.htm">speech</a> 
to the Annual Meetings. Similarly, several seminars and discussions 
on the sidelines in Dubai examined key questions, including the 
Fund's role in low-income countries (see <a href="#3d">article</a>). 
In a recently published <a href="https://www.imf.org/External/np/pdr/sustain/2003/072103.htm">paper</a> 
the Fund reviews the question of how it can best assist low-income 
countries while remaining true to its mandate; on this, feedback 
is sought from the public. In the closely related <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2003/052303.htm">paper 
on debt sustainability</a> discussed in the <a href="080403.html">last 
issue of the newsletter</a>, the Fund has been addressing how 
the international community can best help poor countries, including 
the most heavily indebted, maintain a sustainable debt position 
in the long term.</p>
<p>Civil society organizations (CSOs) also were active at the 
Annual Meetings, especially groups from the Middle East. CSO representatives 
participated in a well-attended <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2003/tr092103a.htm">Townhall 
Meeting</a> with Gordon Brown, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer 
and Chairman of the IMFC; Trevor Manuel, South Africa's Minister 
of Finance and Chairman of the World Bank's Development Committee; 
IMF Managing Director Horst K&ouml;hler; and World Bank President 
James Wolfensohn. It was the first time that this high-powered 
quartet had appeared together in a session with CSO representatives. 
The meeting addressed many issues of concern to CSOs, including 
one of the issues on the Dubai agenda: &quot;voice and representation&quot; 
of developing countries in the governance of the IMF and World 
Bank.</p>
<p>One <a href="#3a">session</a> with CSO representatives covered 
the newly issued IMF &quot;<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/cso/eng/2003/101003.htm">Guide 
for Staff Relations with Civil Society Organizations</a>&quot;, 
prepared in close consultation with Jan Aart Scholte of the Centre 
for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation at the University 
of Warwick in the U.K., and based on interaction with IMF staff 
and civil society groups. The guide has been distributed to Fund 
staff and posted on the external website along with a request 
for public comment. The intention is for the guide to become a 
&quot;living document&quot; that can be reassessed as Fund staff 
gain greater experience in their interaction with civil society.</p>
<p>Finally, this issue features an extended <a href="#2a">interview</a> 
with Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Director of the IMF Independent Evaluation 
Office (IEO), which is charged with conducting assessments of 
the Fund's work. The IEO has become a key intermediate point of 
contact between the IMF and civil society, and Mr. Ahluwalia in 
his interview offers perspectives on that interaction. </p>
<p>As always, the staff of the Civil Society Newsletter welcomes 
suggestions on coverage from our readers around the world. <br>

<p align="center"><i><a name="2"></a>Feature Article</i></p>
<p><b><i><a name="2a"></a>An interview with Montek S. Ahluwalia</i></b></p>
<p><i>Montek Singh Ahluwalia, 60, is the first director of the 
IMF's <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/index.htm">Independent 
Evaluation Office</a>. The IEO was established in 2001 to provide 
objective assessments of the Fund's work. In keeping with that 
objective, the IEO decides its own work program independently 
of the IMF Executive Board and management, and Mr. Ahluwalia and 
his successors are barred from future employment at the IMF. An 
economist, Mr. Ahluwalia began his career in the World Bank in 
1968, returning 11 years later to his native India, where he served 
as Finance Secretary in the Ministry of Finance; Secretary in 
the Department of Economic Affairs; Commerce Secretary; Special 
Secretary to the Prime Minister; and Economic Advisor in the Ministry 
of Finance. Mr. Ahluwalia was educated at Delhi University and 
at Oxford University. He took over the IEO on July 9, 2001.</i></p>
<blockquote> 
<p><b>Q: To what extent do you see CSOs as part of the IEO constituency? 
</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> They are definitely an important part. The IEO was 
set up in part because of the very strong perception on the part 
of CSOs that the Fund was inadequately transparent. As our <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/2003/ar/index.htm">Annual 
Report</a> notes, CSO inputs were prominent in the period when 
the Board was discussing the need to set up this office. Our <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/tor.htm">terms 
of reference</a> also make it clear that one of our responsibilities 
is to create a better understanding of Fund activities among a 
broader group of stakeholders. Any CSO concerned about issues 
that the Fund is concerned about is therefore a natural constituency.</p>
<p><b>Q: What are the methods that the IEO has developed to interact 
with civil society?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> We have developed mechanisms for interaction at several 
stages. First, at the stage of defining the work program, we have 
made provision for lateral inputs. Before defining the work program, 
we first prepare a discussion paper which outlines a menu of possibilities, 
and put it on the Web and invite comments from all concerned, 
including CSOs. We give them six weeks to convey their views on 
which of the proposed topics is more important, or even suggesting 
topics we may have missed. We have also organized discussions 
with civil society groups interested in interacting with us. This 
input is taken into account in determining the work program. </p>
<p>Having chosen a topic, we try to ensure that the terms of reference 
of the study do not prejudge critical issues or fail to reflect 
legitimate concerns. We follow a two-stage method for defining 
the terms of reference. First, we put an issues paper on the website 
indicating our perception of the main issues to be addressed and 
invite comments. After considering the comments received we put 
a final terms of reference on the web. </p>
<p>Finally, we then invite all concerned, including CSOs, to contribute 
substantive inputs on the issues identified in the terms of reference 
as relevant to the study.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is the aim that CSOs decide on the themes and methods 
of your work?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Not to decide<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>that 
is for us to do<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>but 
certainly to give them an opportunity to participate. In the end, 
the responsibility for evaluations rests with the IEO, but by 
consulting extensively we give them an opportunity to be heard. 
They could fairly criticize us if they feel their views have not 
been given fair consideration.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do CSOs participate in the actual evaluation process?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>As I said, we invite CSOs to make submissions to 
us on issues covered in the terms of reference. If some CSO has 
done a lot of work in a particular country or issue, they could 
send their material to us and expect us to take it into account. 
The final report is our responsibility. We don't delegate or subcontract 
evaluations to CSOs, but we are willing to hear their views.</p>
<p>In the ongoing study we're doing of Argentina, we have received 
a huge amount of input, not from traditional CSOs, with whom we 
are in regular contact, but from small groups of Argentine bank 
depositors complaining about what they considered abuse of property 
rights, as they saw it, reflected in asymmetric conversion of 
dollar bank deposits into pesos. I quote this only as an example 
of how issues surface in many different sorts of ways. </p>
<p><b>Q: Is the Web the IEO's only means for interacting with 
far-flung civil society organizations?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No; a pure Web-based interaction cannot possibly 
reach all relevant NGOs so we do resort to direct interaction. 
In a consultation in Africa in 2001, when some of our people met 
with many country delegations, they made us very aware of the 
fact that just because something is on the Web does not mean it 
is easily accessible. Access is a problem in many countries, downloading 
is not easy and there are language problems. We are actively trying 
to make our material more accessible to a non technical audience 
and to regional language groups that may not be familiar with 
English, which is the language of the Fund. In the case of the 
capital-account crisis project, for example, parts of the report 
will be translated and available in the local language. </p>
<p><b>Q: Your office has released three reports to date. What 
are the themes common to them all?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>I can think of several common themes. One relates 
to the tradeoff between candor and transparency. The Fund has 
to play a major role in surveillance, making people aware of issues 
and problems in their countries. To the extent that this work 
is confidential, there is no problem<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>you 
can be as candid as you like in private. However, the extent to 
which countries will be willing to be candid with the Fund is 
a function of how transparent the Fund is going to be. It is not 
easy to strike the right balance.</p>
<p>Excessive optimism at the stage of program formulation is another 
common theme from many country experiences. Yet another issue 
is the time mismatch between the duration of an IMF program and 
the time period needed for longer-term policies to have an impact. 
A program has a span, at most, of three years. But for many structural 
problems, the time frame in which corrective policies can have 
an effect is several years. If you design conditionality to focus 
on generating an effect within three years, you're likely to be 
concentrating on things that have a short-term effect and giving 
less importance to measures that have long-term effect. Yet it 
is the latter that are actually more important. </p>
<p><b>Q: With tension between candor and transparency built into 
the process, to which approach is the IEO inclined?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>We are in favor of the Fund tilting in favor of greater 
importance given to transparency. We recognize that full transparency 
may not be possible on all issues. There are situations where 
transparency can be unduly disruptive and this must be a matter 
of concern, especially where judgments have to be made in the 
face of uncertainty and the probabilistic nature of judgments 
may not be fully recognized. The issue has become accentuated 
because of the perception, after the crises of the 1990s, that 
the Fund must play an important role in keeping markets informed. 
The belief is that better-informed markets will behave better 
and will be more stable. Hence the perception that Fund surveillance 
can play a critical role. If that is to be the Fund's role, surveillance 
has to be more transparent<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>telling 
markets what the Fund really thinks. This can be problematic. 
The desire to retain influence in the advisory role can lead to 
moderation of concerns on policy, but beyond a point this can 
reduce the effectiveness of surveillance. </p>
<p><b>Q: Concerning the time mismatch you spoke of, the irony 
is that it encourages an emphasis on short-term results that multilateral 
organizations like the IMF tend to advise against.</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>That is true. Consider a country that has problems 
of fiscal sustainability because its tax base is too narrow. To 
have an impact in the next two or three years, the simplest thing 
to do may be to take an existing tax and increase the rate. However 
what may be more important in the longer run is to broaden the 
tax base and improve the efficiency of the revenue administration. 
However, it is not very clear that the results would become evident 
in three years. Restructuring a revenue service is simply not 
something that can be done in three years. </p>
<p>So how do you handle the fiscal balance in the short run? Do 
you cut some expenditures somewhere or just live with a bigger 
fiscal deficit? The solution one of our studies has proposed is 
that the Fund should use surveillance to develop an understanding 
of the road map for reform, which is actually owned by the country. 
When programs have to be designed, the Fund could use the road 
map to look for workable solutions drawn from it. Presently, only 
the low-income countries have such a mechanism<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>the 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>which 
spells out a road map. We don't think that non-low-income countries 
should be made to have PRSPs. But we think we should explore the 
possibility of using surveillance to encourage a dialogue with 
countries in nonprogram years and develop their own road map. 
This may make surveillance appear too intrusive, and that is a 
concern that has to be dealt with. </p>
<p><b>Q: The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/2003/fis/index.htm">IEO 
report on fiscal adjustment</a> concluded that social spending 
is not reduced overall as a result of Fund programs<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>which 
would seem to uphold the position of the IMF rather than its critics.</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>The study found mixed results. It does establish 
that some of the common criticisms of Fund programs are not valid 
and aggregate social sector expenditures are not necessarily squeezed. 
On the other hand it also points out that, very often, while total 
social sector expenditures may not be squeezed, many critical 
components do get squeezed when fiscal difficulties arise. If 
demands for real wage increase and the like can't be resisted, 
you might find a situation where wages and salaries in the health 
service go up, but money for medicines goes down.</p>
<p>What should the Fund do? You can't have a Fund program that 
goes into this level of micro-detail. Our recommendation is to 
encourage countries to come forward in normal times with their 
ideas on how they would protect critical programs. The Fund could 
provide a forum through its surveillance mechanism where these 
ideas get discussed. Countries wanting technical assistance to 
develop such mechanisms could get it from the World Bank.</p>
<p><b>Q: Much of what you recommend might be considered intrusive. 
How have governments reacted?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>From our point of view, we must judge the governmental 
response on the basis of the responses in the Executive Board. 
We are gratified that the thrust of our recommendations has received 
broad Board endorsement<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>both 
from the borrowing countries as well the countries that typically 
do not borrow. Sometimes there are mixed views, but you expect 
that. It is true that what we propose often goes beyond what the 
Fund has done traditionally, but we can only add value if we push 
the envelope and see how to take care of legitimate concerns that 
arise.</p>

<p align="center"><i><a name="3"></a>The 2003 Annual Meetings 
in Dubai:</i></p>
<p><b><i><a name="3a"></a>Report from the International Monetary 
and Financial Committee (IMFC)</i></b></p>
      <p>Senior government officials from around the world traveled to the Persian Gulf 
        this year for the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank. The Boards 
        of Governors of the two institutions, made up of ministers and central 
        bank governors from the 184 member countries, gathered in plenary session 
        September 23-24 in the United Arab Emirates state of Dubai. As usual, 
        the gathering was preceded by a separate meeting of the International 
        Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) of the IMF's governors.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03159.htm">IMFC 
        communiqu&eacute;</a> surveyed the global economic climate and welcomed 
        the increasing signs of global recovery. However, the committee also pointed 
        to the risks faced by many countries and highlighted the importance for 
        rich and poor countries alike of sustained and vigorous reforms to underpin 
        balanced growth.</p>
      <p>In addition, the IMFC pointed to a worldwide risk: a threat to the growth 
        of international trade. In its communiqu&eacute;, the committee called 
        urgently for resumption of trade and development negotiations, known as 
        the Doha Round, which broke down earlier in September in Canc&uacute;n, 
        Mexico. Once the talks are back on track, the ministers said, governments 
        should focus on the importance of opening markets, providing fair access, 
        and reducing trade-distorting subsidies in all areas<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8212;</font>especially 
        agriculture. They said trade expansion is essential for vigorous global 
        growth as well as the achievement of internationally recognized development 
        goals. The IMFC supported a Fund initiative to provide assistance to countries 
        to help them adjust to the impact of trade reforms.</p>
      <p>Addressing the challenges faced by the industrial countries, the IMFC 
        recommended that monetary policies should continue to support demand in 
        the context of low inflation, and that fiscal policies should aim to deliver 
        a reduction of deficits in the medium term, while allowing short-term 
        flexibility if activity weakens. The IMFC referred to the vigorous pursuit 
        of structural reforms, and enhanced corporate governance and transparency 
        as key to stronger, globally balanced growth. Among specific recommendations: 
        the United States should aim fiscal policy toward strengthening sustainability 
        in the medium term; Europe should continue structural reforms aimed at 
        boosting employment and investment; and Japan should strengthen its banking 
        and corporate sectors.</p>
      <p>Turning to low-income countries, the committee noted that many have strengthened 
        macroeconomic policies and have undertaken policy reforms, which have 
        improved the prospects for growth. But the ministers also said that growth 
        will have to accelerate significantly in order to reduce poverty and meet 
        the Millennium Development Goals. Stronger policy frameworks and institutions, 
        better governance, improved market access, and larger and more effective 
        aid flows are all needed, the IMFC said.</p>
      <p>The communiqu&eacute; pledged continued IMF support for low-income countries. 
        Initiatives are needed to enhance that support, the IMFC said. These should 
        take the form of such measures as ensuring that macroeconomic policy frameworks 
        support higher and sustained growth and poverty reduction, and reducing 
        vulnerability to shocks. In addition, the IMF should help countries move 
        beyond sustained reliance on IMF financial arrangements. Focusing attention 
        on Africa, the IMFC said African countries should move forward with regionwide 
        implementation of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), 
        especially to strengthen the foundations for investment and private sector-led 
        growth. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the IMFC called on the IMF, in collaboration with the World 
        Bank, to develop strategies to help countries implement the policies needed 
        to obtain the debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) 
        Initiative that would achieve a lasting exit from unsustainable debt. 
        All creditors that have not yet granted full debt relief were urged to 
        do so, with the IMF asked to report on the extent of compliance. The communiqu&eacute; 
        also recognized the importance of providing &quot;topping-up&quot; assistance 
        to HIPC recipients as appropriate, and cited the on-going discussions 
        on the topping-up methodology and financial implications.</p>
      <p>The IMFC expressed support for a multilateral effort to rebuild Iraq, 
        and approved the idea of the Fund providing financial and other assistance 
        to that country.</p>
      <p>The IMFC reaffirmed that strengthened IMF surveillance is essential to 
        enhancing crisis prevention and promoting stability and sustainable and 
        effective growth. The Committee said it would discuss in 2004 progress 
        in improving the quality, effectiveness and persuasiveness of IMF surveillance. 
        The communiqu&eacute; emphasized the importance of greater transparency 
        and candor in IMF advice to member countries. The Committee also welcomed 
        the work of the two-year-old Independent Evaluation Office (see <a href="#2a">related 
        story</a> in this issue) in enhancing the learning culture, effectiveness 
        and accountability of the IMF.</p>

<p align="left"><i><a name="3b"></a><b>Civil society dialogues 
in Dubai</b></i></p>
<p>The Annual Meetings provide extensive opportunities for consultations 
and seminars alongside the formal meetings. The Dubai authorities 
made excellent provision for CSO representatives attending the 
meetings, which facilitated a program of civil society dialogues 
that extended over the better part of a week. Some sessions were 
organized by CSOs themselves, while others were arranged by officials 
of the two institutions. Given that these were the first Annual 
Meetings in the Middle East, and that many CSO representatives 
from the region had not attended previous meetings, the discussions 
included an overview of work in the <a href="#3e">Middle East 
and North Africa</a>. Other sessions focused on <a href="#3d">low-income 
countries</a> and <a href="#3e">Fund outreach to CSOs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<p><b><i><a name="3c"></a></i>The IMF in the Middle East and North 
Africa</b></p>
<p>Mohamad Chatah and Zubair Iqbal (of the IMF's External Relations 
and Middle Eastern Departments, respectively) conducted a session 
designed to outline the diversity of the Fund's work in the Middle 
East and North Africa (MENA) region. This diversity reflected 
the wide geographic coverage of the department, which includes 
not just Arabic-speaking countries, but countries as far flung 
as Sudan and Pakistan. And the coverage is about to get even wider, 
following a reorganization that brings several Central Asian countries 
into the renamed Middle East and Central Asia Department (effective 
November 1). </p>
<p>Questions from the 15 participants reflected many of the key 
concerns of the region, most going well beyond the attainment 
of macroeconomic stability. In economic policy advice, should 
more emphasis be placed on achieving better income distribution 
than on growth? Could the Fund support progress toward democracy? 
Could the Fund impose conditionality that would promote good governance? 
What could the Fund do to support Palestine? What capacity building 
support could the Fund give to civil society organizations? </p>
<p>The Fund's mandate means that it cannot address all these issues 
directly or on its own. Iqbal and Chatah explained that the Fund 
has three main activities: policy advice and dialogue through 
&quot;surveillance&quot;, capacity building through technical 
assistance, and lending. The Fund's mandate centers on macroeconomic 
and financial policies, but advice inevitably goes well beyond 
a narrow focus on macroeconomic stability. Structural change is 
uppermost on the agenda in many countries: financial sector reform; 
strengthening public sector finances through tax and expenditure 
reform; promoting transparency; and working with countries as 
they attempt to diversify their economies. </p>
<p>In post-conflict situations<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>such 
as Afghanistan, Iraq, or Palestine<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>the 
Fund's work emphasizes the capacity-building necessary to put 
in place the rudiments of effective monetary and financial systems 
and public sector management. Such technical advice and assistance 
is extended even where it is not possible to provide loans. In 
these situations, and indeed in most countries, the Fund works 
closely with other international agencies<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>the 
World Bank, the United Nations and bilateral donors<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>to 
make sure that its contribution is effective and consistent with 
national objectives and international strategies.</p>

<p><b><i><a name="3d"></a></i>The role of the IMF in low-income 
countries </b></p>
<p>The IMF has <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2003/pn03117.htm">initiated</a> 
public discussion of a <a href="https://www.imf.org/External/np/pdr/sustain/2003/072103.htm">paper</a> 
on the role of the IMF in low-income member countries. The Annual 
Meetings in Dubai provided a good opportunity for direct dialogue 
on the issues. Two seminars took place in Dubai, one for officials 
and visitors to the Annual Meetings, and the other specifically 
for civil society organizations. The article below combines perspectives 
from both sessions.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="3e"></a></i>Defining the issues</b><br>
Opening both sessions, Mark Plant, Advisor in the IMF Policy Development 
and Review Department, argued that to improve the prospects for 
low-income countries to realize the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs), countries need to adopt policies that promote growth and 
poverty reduction. But they will also need to receive much more 
assistance<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>both 
technical and financial<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>with 
a larger proportion of grant aid. How can the IMF assist most 
effectively, given that it is not primarily a development institution 
and has neither the capacity nor the mandate to contribute to 
substantial long-term flows of resources needed to meet the MDGs? 
The Fund can support countries by helping them establish macroeconomic 
stability as the foundation for sustained growth and to deal with 
shocks from beyond their borders. </p>
<p>But how can IMF-supported programs look beyond macroeconomic 
stability to promote sustained faster growth and poverty reduction? 
</p>
<p>Plant highlighted several principles that would help guide 
the debate. The IMF will remain engaged with low-income countries 
over the long term, by embracing the Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Paper (PRSP) process as the framework for working with countries 
to achieve the MDGs. More aid is desirable, but for the long term 
the aim should be to help countries rely on private sources of 
financing. And the IMF must work with developed countries to ensure 
their policies<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>especially 
in trade and agriculture<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>support 
growth in low-income countries. The IMF will focus on its core 
areas of competence: macroeconomic and financial policies. Its 
primary assistance will be policy advice, given through surveillance 
and technical assistance, and in programs supported by the Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) lending.</p>
<p><b>The debate: an overview</b><br>
Participants welcomed the IMF's willingness to undertake the review. 
Most discussants called for the increased emphasis on country 
ownership to be matched by greater flexibility on the part of 
the IMF. Lucie Kasanga of Jubilee Zambia stressed how important 
it was that the Fund should undertake more country-level assessments, 
arguing that it needs to focus more on the social and political 
setting in which economic policy and poverty reduction strategies 
are being designed. She also thought it unfortunate that the IMF 
had ruled out a broader review of PRSPs.</p>
<p>Saifur Rahman, Minister of Finance and Planning of Bangladesh, 
argued, that the IMF and World Bank need to achieve a higher degree 
of coordination if their advice to countries is to become more 
effective. Rahman also stressed that private capital flows would 
come only after developing countries establish an environment 
conducive to private sector development<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>truly 
a long-term process. Ulan Sarbanov, Chairman of the National Bank 
of the Kyrgyz Republic, argued that the IMF still needs to pay 
attention to issues outside of its core areas. For example, if 
a country has a large public sector, the IMF must look not only 
at tax policy but also at the energy sector or the financial sector 
if that is where macroeconomic problems are rooted.</p>
<p>Paul Ladd of Christian Aid argued that the Fund's advice should 
be firmly rooted in the MDGs, and use poverty and social impact 
analyses. He also felt that the Fund's &quot;gatekeeping&quot; 
role<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>the 
reliance by donors and investors on IMF-supported lending as the 
trigger for their own lending<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>needs 
to be reduced.</p>
<p>Discussion was wide ranging. A recurring theme was the need 
to base the Fund's work on the MDGs, and related to that, the 
critical importance of being able to contribute to reducing the 
impact of HIV/AIDS on Africa's economies. Others called for closer 
links between the programs supported by IMF lending to poor countries 
and their poverty-reduction strategies to ensure that the conditions 
of the former do not hinder the goals of the latter. </p>
<p>Participants also questioned aspects of IMF-supported polices, 
particularly privatization<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>whose 
benefits, they argued, have not been proved<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>and 
what they alleged to be the mechanistic approach to the formulation 
of stabilization programs. One participant argued that it would 
be better to concentrate on income distribution rather than growth, 
which is skewed toward the rich. Other speakers commented on the 
important role that technical assistance can play, and many echoed 
the call for greater flexibility and sensitivity in policy advice.

<p><b><i><a name="3f"></a></i>Guide to IMF Staff Relations with 
CSOs - Public discussion begins</b></p>
<p>CSO representatives in Dubai gave a qualified welcome to the 
IMF's proposed &quot;Guide for Staff Relations with Civil Society 
Organizations&quot; shortly before it was launched. The Guide 
has now been issued to the IMF staff, and has been <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/cso/eng/2003/101003.htm">published</a> 
with an invitation to comment. In Dubai, a panel discussion on 
the Guide included Michael Bell of the IMF External Relations 
Department; Alan Whaites, Director of International Policy and 
Advocacy for World Vision International; and Wahyu Widiarto, Director 
of the Institute of Development and Economic Analysis in Indonesia. 
Altogether there were about 25 participants at the session.</p>
<p>Bell outlined the consultative process that had led to the 
draft: (i) a first draft prepared by Jan Aart Scholte, professor 
at the Centre for the Study of Globalisaton and Regionalisation 
at the University of Warwick in the U.K., based on consultations 
with IMF staff; (ii) a second draft prepared after an extensive 
process of comment coordinated by Scholte in which a panel of 
about 30 CSO representatives reviewed the document in parallel 
with an internal IMF review; and (iii) a final draft after a last 
round of Fund staff review. Bell said that the process had revealed 
a surprising amount of outreach already being undertaken by staff 
throughout the Fund. But he also noted that an almost universal 
concern on the part of staff had been about the &quot;resource 
implications&quot; of more extensive outreach. Striking the right 
balance had been one important factor addressed in the final round 
of reviews.</p>
<p>Whaites recalled an earlier World 
Vision paper that had identified three essential areas<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>capacity, 
culture, and process<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>in 
which the Fund would have to act if it was improve its relations 
with civil society. He said the draft guide addressed only one 
of these: process. Based on World Vision's experience, relations 
in the field with Fund staff were often difficult. There is still 
much to be done, especially in terms of enhancing the Fund's capacity 
to undertake effective outreach in-country. He also regretted 
the &quot;indeterminate state&quot; of the note: an indicative 
<i>guide</i> rather than a more prescriptive <i>guidance note</i>, 
which had been the earlier proposal.</p>
<p>The key question or test was whether ownership was being promoted, 
Wahyu argued. The Guide seemed to confirm the remoteness between 
the elites<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>the 
decision makers<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8212;</font>and 
the people. For instance he asked how in a huge country like Indonesia, 
ownership can be advanced through the CSOs. The barriers are enormous: 
the CSOs have little access to information, to the decision-making 
processes, or the decision-makers. How can real progress be made? 
</p>
<ul>
<li>These concerns were amplified in a lively discussion that 
followed:<br>
</li>
<li>The approach is too cautious; there is too much sensitivity 
to the interests of the governments;<br>
</li>
<li>The Guide seems incomplete, missing many institutional details, 
in particular what role civil society itself plays in the country;<br>
</li>
<li>Expecting staff to assess the &quot;legal status&quot; of 
CSOs is a concern in countries where civil society has limited 
rights or standing;<br>
</li>
<li>In assessing the legitimacy of CSOs, staff should be aware 
that governments sometimes create artificial CSOs;<br>
</li>
<li>Fund staff should not let concerns about resource costs overwhelm 
their intention to pursue dialogue; staff need to find ways of 
making the time, giving up other activities if necessary;<br>
</li>
<li>Dialogue often simply does not exist. People still have the 
sense that nobody is listening to their concerns, for example 
in the recent controversy over electricity prices in Argentina.<br>
</li>
<li>The Fund should not reinvent the wheel; it should draw on 
the experience and expertise of other international organizations, 
in particular, the World Bank and the United Nations.<br>
</li>

<p align="center"><i><a name="4"></a>Letters from the Field</i></p>
<p><b><i><a name="4a"></a>A Visit to Southern Ecuador<br>
David Yuravlivker, Resident Representative, Ecuador</i></b></p>
<p>I joined Mac Benjamin, the World Bank representative in Ecuador, 
for a half-day meeting with civil society and local authorities 
in the southern province of Loja. This was one of a series of 
meetings organized as a follow-up to the consultations with civil 
society that took place in preparation for the recent Country 
Strategy Paper. </p>
<p>The first part of the discussion focused on World Bank strategy 
in Ecuador, and the second part on the economic situation and 
prospects. Some 30 people attended, among them representatives 
of indigenous communities in the province.</p>
<p>Issues raised by the audience included: the social costs of 
migration to other countries; the lack of access to credit by 
communities and businesses; the increase in poverty and its relationship 
to dollarization; the apparent conflict between multilateral financial 
institutions and the social movements; the perceived failure of 
the multilaterals to listen to citizens at the grass roots; and 
the need to ensure that the poor do not always bear the weight 
of adjustment programs.</p>
<p>I described the numerous discussions we had had with indigenous 
leaders at the national level, and pointed out that we are open 
to views at the local level. Then I outlined our program and stressed 
that most of its components addressed their very concerns head-on, 
including anti-corruption measures aimed at the Customs Office 
and the Agencia de Garantia de Depositos (Deposit Guarantee Agency). 
There was also a question about the cooking gas subsidy, which 
prompted an explanation of our argument in favor of transparent 
subsidies to people rather than regressive subsidies targeted 
at commodities. The audience showed great interest in our approach.</p>
<p>In the evening, we had dinner with the Mayor of Loja and with 
the Rector of the Universidad T&eacute;cnica Particular de Loja. 
The Mayor is very dynamic, has a nationwide reputation, and has 
been re-elected several times. He puts great stock in environmental 
protection, an approach reflected in the clean and well-kept appearance 
of the town. Roughly speaking, one third of city's revenues come 
from local taxes, one-third from central government transfers, 
and the rest from external sources. His main complaints are that 
the central government is behind in transfer payments, and that 
the major cities, Quito and Guayaquil, take what they want, leaving 
the rest of the cities to struggle for what is left. </p>
<p>All in all, the visit was productive. In particular, it was 
very useful to participate in the forum organized by the World 
Bank, which has an ongoing dialogue with civil society, to have 
the opportunity to explain our program and to hear directly from 
people at the local level. Townspeople appreciated the Fund visiting 
the city to hear from them and hoped to have other opportunities 
to continue the dialogue with us.</p>

<p><b><i><a name="4b"></a>A Meeting with Guinea's Private Sector<br>
Dennis Jones, Resident Representative, Guinea</i></b></p>
<p>I met the Conseil National du Secteur Priv&eacute; en Guin&eacute;e 
(National Council of the Private Sector in Guinea) on August 21, 
together with the Canadian Ambassador, to explain in general terms 
the role of the IMF and to discuss the Fund's current relationship 
with Guinea and recent policy recommendations. The main issue 
was the fact that the current economic program is off-track. The 
exchange was lively and open and the executives gave many examples 
of the difficulties they face. We, in turn, had the opportunity 
to clarify important aspects of the IMF's role, such as the fact 
that we do not give direct budget support to governments or lend 
money directly to private enterprises, and to make the distinction 
between the IMF and the World Bank. This meeting will be followed 
by regular meetings of a similar kind, perhaps every three months. 
To help get a better understanding of the IMF's activities, I 
also held a roundtable meeting with the local and international 
press in Guinea on August 12. </p>
<p>The meetings with the press and with the industrialists were 
fully and fairly reported in the local media. Visiting IMF missions 
usually meet a range of civil groups, most recently during the 
Article IV consultation in May 2003. My intention is to meet with 
a broad range of civil groups in the coming months. </p>
<p>In an effort to make material about the IMF and Guinea more 
accessible, the resident mission in Guinea has launched a new 
web site (<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/country/gin/rr/index.htm">www.imf.org/conakry</a>). 
It contains some IMF documents and other information in both English 
and French. The existence of the web site has been made known 
to a wide range of groups (donors, government agencies, civil 
organizations). The feedback so far has been positive.<br>

<p><b><i><a name="4c"></a>Sri Lankan Civil Society Speaks Out<br>
Jeremy Carter, Senior Resident Representative, Sri Lanka</i></b></p>
<p>As part of the office dialogue with civil society, I met 16 
representatives from local community groups on July 29 in Colombo 
in advance of the Article IV mission in August. The civil society 
representatives raised questions about the way Fund programs are 
designed and carried out, and about their own government's handling 
of economic policy. These are politically charged issues, but 
the discussion was friendly.</p>
<p>Among the participants were critics of the government's development 
strategy, as laid out in &quot;Regaining Sri Lanka&quot;, which 
has been endorsed by the IMF and World Bank as an appropriate 
basis for Fund/Bank lending operations. In particular, Sarath 
Fernando of the Movement for National Land and Agricultural Reform 
argued that the plan would widen the gap between rich and poor, 
and promote migration to cities by the rural poor. He added that 
the strategy's authors had not been responsive to suggestions 
from critics.</p>
<p>From the Fund side, I explained that Fund support for the strategy 
as a whole did not imply agreement with every word. I also noted 
that previous anti-poverty strategies adopted by both the current 
and previous governments and endorsed by the Fund had achieved 
positive results. To a related point raised by Sarath Iddamalgoda 
of Janawa Bode Kundara (Public Awareness), who criticized working 
and living conditions in free trade zones, I noted that the IMF 
disapproved of labor violations and was encouraging the government 
to work with the unions in their plans to revise the labor market 
legislation.</p>
      <p>Gloria De Silva of the Center for Family Services criticized parliamentary 
        oversight of economic policy as weak. I said the Fund welcomes greater 
        participation by Members of Parliament, but agreed that currently there 
        was only limited interaction. Responding to related questions about conditionality 
        in IMF-supported programs, and about the quality of government data, I 
        said I was reasonably assured that government figures are accurate. I 
        noted that CSOs are encouraged to contact the IMF if they have any questions 
        about the data being used to monitor the Fund-supported program. As for 
        loan conditions, I noted that all governments that borrow from the Fund 
        commit themselves to achieving certain numerical targets and to adopting 
        policies that are key to achieving the overall objectives of their economic 
        program. Nevertheless, these targets were more signals than strict unbending 
        tests and were aimed at allowing the country government and the Fund to 
        monitor and, if necessary, adjust policies.</p>
<p>I welcomed the continued flow of ideas from civil society, 
stressing that the Fund is willing to incorporate civil society's 
ideas in future lending programs, although there would be no guarantee 
of blanket acceptance of such proposals. But even those that are 
rejected enrich the policy debate. In that vein, the participants 
were invited to meet the IMF mission in August to continue the 
dialogue (a meeting did take place), noting that similar meetings 
were also being arranged with the unions.</p>

<li>Axel Palmason, UN Office participated in a September 18 roundtable 
discussion with <b>UN-NGOs</b> in New York on ways to finance 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) entitled <i>Feasible Additional 
Sources of Finance for Development</i>. The specific issues under 
discussion included the proposed International Finance Facility, 
SDRs, and international taxation and tax cooperation. Mr. Palmason 
tried to frame the issue in the context of the broader two-pillar 
approach from Monterrey, highlighting the need for an underlying 
balance between domestic policies, aid, trade, and debt relief. 
He also participated in a conference on the role of CSOs in conflict 
prevention, which considered the role of development assistance, 
and a briefing on the political economy of armed conflict.</li>

<p><b><i><a name="5b"></a></i></b><i>IMF Staff News and Organizational 
Changes</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Timothy Geithner, Director, PDR will leave the IMF in November 
to become <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03170.htm">President 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>. Mr. Geithner joined 
the IMF in 2001 from the U.S. Treasury Department, where he had 
served in various positions, including as Undersecretary for International 
Affairs. IMF Managing Director Horst K&ouml;hler said that an 
appointment to fill Mr. Geithner's position will be made in due 
course.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/bios/ss.htm">Shigemitsu 
Sugisaki</a>, Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, will leave 
his position around the beginning of 2004. Mr. Sugisaki joined 
the Fund as Special Advisor to the Managing Director in August 
1994 and was appointed Deputy Managing Director in February 1997 
for an initial term of five years. He was appointed to a second 
term in February 2002. Takatoshi Kato, a Japanese national, has 
been <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03166.htm">announced</a> 
as his successor. The former Japanese Vice Minister of Finance 
for International Affairs is currently Advisor to the President 
of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and a Visiting Professor at Waseda 
University.<br>
</li>
<li>Effective November 1, the IMF has <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03130.htm">undertaken 
a consolidation</a> of its area departments, reducing the number 
from six to five. The organizational changes follow an internal 
review of how best to structure and manage the Fund's area departments. 
In particular, in light of the changing nature of its work, the 
European II Department (EU2), which comprised countries of the 
former Soviet Union, has been dissolved. Seven <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03130.htm">countries</a> 
in EU2 have moved to the European I Department, which has been 
renamed the European Department (EUR). The other eight EU2 countries 
have moved to the Middle Eastern Department (MED), which has been 
renamed the Middle East and Central Asia Department (MCD). Michael 
Deppler, who previously headed EU1, is now Director of EUR. On 
September 1, <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/bio/eng/mk.htm">Mohsin 
Khan</a>, former Director of the IMF Institute, moved to MED as 
Associate Director, and will assume the title of Director, MCD, 
upon the retirement in December of the present Director, <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/bio/eng/ga.htm">George 
Abed</a>. <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/bio/eng/jos.htm">John 
Odling-Smee</a>, who has led EU2 since its inception, has announced 
his intention to retire in early 2004.</li>
