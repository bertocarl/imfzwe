      <p>In this issue, the Civil Society Newsletter takes a new step toward providing 
        a newsworthy account of the International Monetary Fund's work from the 
        perspective of interaction with civil society organizations. It is a mark 
        of the importance we attach to the Fund's relations with civil society 
        that we want to offer a clear window onto our activities. The stories 
        in this issue address some of the most important issues facing the world 
        economy, but try to do so in a more concise and approachable style. This 
        approach to the Newsletter is just one part of a broader, ongoing effort 
        to expand the Fund's involvement with civil society.</p>
      <p>In this regard, many readers will recall that we sent out a special, 
        single-story <a href="032803.htm">edition</a> 
        of the Civil Society Newsletter in March to announce a project aimed at 
        enhancing the interaction of IMF staff with civil society. This project&#8212;whose 
        main aim is to devise practical, in-depth guidance to mission leaders 
        and resident representatives for their relationships with civil society 
        organizations&#8212;is being assisted by Prof. Jan Aart Scholte of the 
        Centre for Globalisation and Regionalisation at the University of Warwick 
        and a specialist in the relationship of civil society with multilateral 
        institutions, particularly the IMF. The lead feature article in this issue 
        of the Newsletter is an interview with Prof. Scholte. The development 
        of the guide will be a central part of the External Relations Department's 
        work with civil society in the coming months. Prof. Scholte will be seeking 
        input on his draft paper from a range of civil society organizations&#8212;especially 
        in the global South&#8212;in the coming weeks, and we expect to post a 
        revised version on our website (<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">www.imf.org</a>) 
        for comment later in the year. We look forward to your comments and input 
        as this guide is intended to be updated regularly.</p>
      <p>This issue also includes articles on several key aspects of the Fund's 
        work over the past quarter: the April meeting of the International Monetary 
        and Financial Committee; a recently released Research Department study 
        on financial globalization and several important meetings with civil society.

      <p align="center"><i><a name="2"></a>Feature Article</i></p>
      <p><b><i><a name="2a"></a>An interview with Professor Jan Aart Scholte</i></b></p>
      <p>Prof. Jan Aart Scholte of the Centre for Globalisation and Regionalisation 
        at the University of Warwick in Britain is the author of &quot; Civil 
        Society Voices and the International Monetary Fund,&quot;. He is preparing 
        a guide for IMF staff concerning their relations with civil society organizations 
        (see <a href="032803.htm">special edition 
        of the Quartely Newsletter for Civil Society</a>). Scholte spoke about 
        the project during a March visit to IMF headquarters in Washington to 
        work on the project. Excerpts:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Q: How long have you been researching the relationship between the 
          IMF and civil society?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>About eight years, including fieldwork in Argentina, Brazil, 
          Canada, Egypt, the European Union, India, Mexico, Romania, Russia, Thailand, 
          Uganda and the US. When I first applied for a research grant in 1995 
          to look into this subject, contacts between the IMF and civil society 
          groups were quite limited, particularly in program countries, but my 
          hunch that the relations would increase has been borne out.</p>
        <p><b>Q: What is the point of trying to improve relations between civil 
          society organizations and the IMF?</b></p>
        <p>A<b>: </b>If we look at the politics of governance of the global economy, 
          civil society is a growing force. Contacts between civil society organizations 
          and global economic institutions are growing as well. It is important 
          to make those relations as constructive and positive as possible<b>. 
          </b>We're now at a point, after 10 or 15 years of increasing exchanges 
          between the Fund and civil society, that we can take stock, assess good 
          experiences, evaluate unhappy experiences and learn from them.</p>
        <p><b>Q: You described in your report an institutional culture at the 
          IMF that wasn't entirely open to dialogue with civil society organizations. 
          Has that changed?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> Somewhat to my own surprise, most staff now do not question 
          the principle that the IMF should have relations with civil society. 
          Eight years ago, the widespread view at the Fund was that engaging with 
          civil society associations would alienate government authorities and 
          damage the prospects of a successful program implementation. Nowadays 
          the widespread view is that engaging with civil society groups is part 
          of building the political ground for a constructive implementation of 
          programs.</p>
        <p><b>Q: Then why is any guidance needed?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>The doing of it is far more in question. IMF staff have a 
          lot more doubt, a lot more caution about whom to meet from civil society, 
          when to meet, how to meet, where to meet. How can Fund staff assure 
          that they meet a wide array of groups that will reflect various views 
          within the society that they are trying to engage with? Should they 
          talk with groups only in the context of program negotiations, or also 
          in the context of a mission visit or an Article IV consultation? Or 
          should they have an ongoing discussion? When talking with civil society 
          associations, can Fund staff get caught up in local political conflicts 
          that they don't understand? There is general recognition at the IMF 
          of the diversity of situations and the variability of situations that 
          makes relations with civil society associations complicated. A guide 
          can help to clarify these complexities and give staff more confidence 
          in their outreach to civil society groups.</p>
        <p><b>Q: How long will the guide be?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>At a guess, around 10 pages - so it will be more than a paragraph 
          but less than a chapter. This is a guide for everyday practical use 
          by IMF staff. It's not an academic essay and it's not a dissection of 
          the minutiae. </p>
        <p><b>Q: What kind of contract do you have with the IMF?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>I am doing this work pro bono, with payment only of expenses. 
          It seems to me that on a subject like this, which is politically sensitive 
          in many peoples' eyes, you need to be - and be seen to be - a facilitator 
          of a dialogue and an honest broker.<b> </b></p>
        <p><b>Q: How are you going about this project?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>What I have done this week is talk with staff, while also 
          trying to collect various examples of happy and unhappy experiences 
          of relations with civil society groups. And I've put to staff for their 
          reaction a draft outline of what the guide might contain. I am also 
          asking for reflections on the proposed outline from a group of around 
          30 civil society practitioners who have experience in relations with 
          international financial institutions or global governance agencies more 
          generally. This group has North-South balance and gender diversity.<b> 
          </b></p>
        <p><b>Q: The next step?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>I will draft a note. That draft will come back to the Fund 
          in early May when I will do a return visit here. Likewise, there will 
          be a second round of input from the civil society group on the fuller 
          draft. In the middle of the year or so, that ultimate draft will be 
          posted on the IMF website, at which point all and sundry can also throw 
          in their views.</p>
        <p><b>Q: After that?</b></p>
        <p>A:. The exercise is not worth my time if it doesn't have concrete impact. 
          As a first step, for example, I would suggest that IMF Resident Representatives 
          make the guide the basis of a meeting with prominent civil society groups 
          in their countries. The IMF would thereby get feedback from the groups 
          about how the note might be adjusted or amended to fit their circumstances. 
          That would also guarantee that a wide array of civil society groups 
          in program countries become aware of the note and become aware of the 
          IMF's commitment to improve relations with civil society groups. </p>
        <p><b>Q: In what regions does the IMF-civil society relationship matter 
          most?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>In countries where the IMF is an active participant in the 
          macroeconomic policy arena. And it's in those countries where civil 
          society engagement with the IMF is often the most underdeveloped. If 
          these guidelines were to end up being mainly discussed and debated by 
          civil society groups in the North who already have the best access, 
          who already have the most input, who already have the most influence, 
          that, to me, would be a regrettable outcome.<b> </b></p>
        <p><b>Q: In how many parts of the world do governments take a dim view 
          of the IMF consulting with civil society organizations?</b><i> </i></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>Certainly there are instances where authorities have been 
          uncomfortable or downright opposed to these contacts. But that wariness 
          can easily be exaggerated. There have in fact been few cases where government 
          authorities have said outright that they did not want Fund staff to 
          engage either with particular civil society groups or with civil society 
          in general. There are other cases where governments will subtly hint 
          they are uncomfortable with these consultations. But most governments 
          are far more accepting. There could even be a tendency for some IMF 
          staff to use arguments about purported sensitivities on the part of 
          the authorities as a rationalization for their own disinclination to 
          engage with civil society groups.<b> </b></p>

      <p align="center"><i><a name="3"></a>The Spring Meetings</i></p>
      <p><b><i><a name="3a"></a>Report from the International Monetary and Finance 
        Committee (IMFC)</i></b></p>
      <p>The International Monetary and Finance Committee (IMFC) held its <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/spring/2003/index.htm">2003 
        Spring Meeting</a> at a time of uncertainty about the international economy. 
        The April 12 gathering of the IMFC, which meets twice a year, came as 
        the war in Iraq was beginning to wind down. But the end of fighting left 
        many concerns about the effects of the conflict. The meeting dealt with 
        these issues, as well as with worries about the status of the effort to 
        assist the world's poorest countries and the ongoing campaign to devise 
        better methods to prevent and resolve economic crises.</p>
      <p>The IMFC <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr0350.htm">communiqu&eacute;</a>, 
        issued at the close of the session, reaffirmed the IMF's commitment to 
        close international cooperation to support the global recovery . &quot;It 
        is a mark of the commitment of all that even in these challenging and 
        difficult times we have been able to look beyond the here and now in examining 
        all the long-term issues that the world economy faces,&quot; said Gordon 
        Brown, Chairman of the IMFC and U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer, at a 
        press conference after the meeting.</p>
      <p>On postwar Iraq, the IMFC supported a further UN Security Council resolution 
        and reaffirmed the role of the IMF and World Bank in restoring &quot;sustained 
        economic, social, and political development in Iraq.&quot; The communiqu&eacute; 
        said both institutions &quot;stand ready to play their normal role in 
        Iraq's redevelopment at the appropriate time.&quot; Asked at the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2003/tr030412.htm">press 
        conference</a> to define &quot;normal,&quot; IMF Managing Director Horst 
        K&ouml;hler said that the committee viewed its responsibilities in Iraq 
        in the same way as it had approached post-conflict projects in Kosovo, 
        Afghanistan and East Timor and elsewhere. Mr. K&ouml;hler said a fact-finding 
        mission could be sent to Iraq when the situation on the ground is safe.</p>
      <p>On the global economy, the IMFC called on the advanced economies to undertake 
        policies that would &quot;deliver strong growth in the second half of 
        the year.&quot; The communiqu&eacute; placed additional emphasis on actions 
        by the advanced economies that would &quot;address medium-term fiscal 
        pressures&quot;&#8212;especially in the U.S.&#8212;and enhance needed 
        structural reforms in Europe and Japan. The communiqu&eacute; called on 
        emerging market countries to continue developing their resilience to global 
        developments by strengthening macroeconomic stability and pursuing structural 
        reforms.</p>
      <p>For the low-income countries, the IMFC said that prospects for stronger 
        economic growth &quot;should be supported by improved economic policies, 
        stronger institutions, progress in resolving regional conflicts, and increased 
        donor resources, including through debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.&quot; 
        It said that the IMF continues to play an important role in helping lower-income 
        countries make progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals. 
        &quot;The Committee recognizes the urgent need to enhance market access 
        and to increase the level and effectiveness of donor resources for developing 
        countries,&quot; the communiqu&eacute; said. The committee called on the 
        IMF to continue its work on <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/2003/eng/042503.pdf">aligning 
        poverty reduction strategy papers</a> (PRSPs), the Poverty Reduction and 
        Growth Facility, and individual country's budgets. &quot;This will be 
        facilitated through more realistic economic projections, systematic analysis 
        of the sources of growth, effective Bank-Fund collaboration, and flexibility 
        in program design, including to accommodate higher aid inflows,&quot; 
        the IMFC said. The Committee also looked forward to the analysis of the 
        role of the IMF in low-income countries over the medium term.</p>
      <p>On the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, the IMFC welcomed recent 
        <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/povdebt.htm">additional progress</a> on 
        debt relief, but also noted the delays that some countries face in reaching 
        the completion point or in overcoming obstacles to participation. The 
        committee said it looked forward to a review of these issues that will 
        be presented at its next meeting in September in Dubai. The IMFC reaffirmed 
        the commitment to full funding of the HIPC initiative, and welcomed the 
        efforts by some countries to provide additional debt relief.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b> A Discussion on the Current Status of HIPC:</b> Masood Ahmed, 
          Deputy Director, Brian Ames, Advisor, and Martin Gilman, Assistant Director 
          from the Policy Development and Review Department represented the IMF 
          at this joint IMF and World Bank session. Gobind Nankani, Vice President 
          for Poverty Reduction and Economic Management; Vikram Nehru, Manager 
          of the HIPC Unit, Sudhir Shetty, Sector Manager for Poverty Reduction; 
          Victoria Elliot, and Madhur Gautam, Operations Evaluation Department 
          (OED), represented the Bank. Approximately 60 NGOs (35 attendees and 
          25 via video conference in Zambia, Nicaragua, Honduras, Belgium, UK 
          and Ghana) participated.<br>
          <br>
          The purpose of the meeting was to update CSOs on the status of HIPC, 
          provide stakeholders in HIPC countries with the opportunity to share 
          their views and experiences with Bank and Fund staff, and give a brief 
          overview of the World Bank's OED study on HIPC.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b> Fiscal Transparency</b>: Bill Allan, Section Chief, Fiscal Affairs 
          Department, IMF gave an overview of the Code of Good Practices on Fiscal 
          Transparency and the progress being made with country assessments of 
          transparency. Murray Petrie, consultant, Fiscal Affairs Department reviewed 
          the role played by private sector financial analysts and NGOs in using 
          the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/fiscal.htm">fiscal transparency 
          code</a> and <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/rosc.asp">Reports on the Observance 
          of Standards and Codes</a> (ROSCs). <br>
          <br>
          Warren Krafchik, and Joel Friedman, both from the International Budget 
          Project (IBP), discussed work to promote budget transparency and public 
          participation in the budget process. Approximately 20 NGO representatives 
          attended the meeting. Much of the information presented was new to the 
          participants but most agreed it was an important area and said they 
          intended to follow it more closely. A range of topics was covered in 
          discussion, including the extent to which transparency assessments involved 
          CSOs and parliamentarians, whether publication of ROSCs should be publicized 
          more within countries, and the use of ROSCs for Fund conditionality.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>An Update of the Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM</b>): 
          <br>
          Approximately 15 NGOs attended this session with Sean Hagan, Deputy 
          General Counsel, Legal Department. Participants were mostly interested 
          in learning whether the Fund will continue pressing for an SDRM, and 
          raised questions about CSO involvement in the SDRM discussions. Mr. 
          Hagan described the process under which the SDRM was considered and 
          presented to the IMFC. Opposition came mostly from the U.S. and several 
          emerging market countries. 70 percent of the Fund's membership, in terms 
          of voting power, supported the initiative. He stated it is unlikely 
          that further work will be undertaken at this stage regarding the operational 
          aspects of the SDRM, but suggested the Fund will continue discussing 
          issues of general relevance to a crisis resolution framework. <br>
          <br>
          In response to complaints about the role of CSOs in the discussions, 
          IMF staff asserted that the process was open and that the dialogue the 
          Fund had initiated with CSOs on the SDRM was unprecedented. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Update on the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) Work Program:</b> 
          IEO Director Montek Ahluwalia and Deputy Director David Goldsbrough 
          talked with 12 civil society representatives about the IEO's work program, 
          especially the evaluation of PRSPs and PRGF currently underway. Questions 
          ranged from details of the PRSP/PRGF study to the IEO evaluation process 
          and follow-up studies. Ahluwalia stressed that the IEO will not constantly 
          monitor the whole range of the Fund's work, but important issues will 
          re-surface in the context of different evaluations. There is also the 
          possibility that certain follow-up studies will be incorporated in future 
          IEO work programs, which are determined on the basis of internal discussions 
          and broad based consultations.</li>

      <p><b><i><a name="4a"></a>Paper on financial globalization </i></b></p>
      <p>The IMF recently published a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/res/docs/2003/031703.pdf">research 
        paper</a> discussing the effects of financial globalization on developing 
        countries. The new study, &quot;Effects of Financial Globalization on 
        Developing Countries&#8212;Some Empirical Evidence&quot;, by Eswar Prasad, 
        Kenneth Rogoff, Shang-Jin Wei, and M. Ayhan Kose contributes to a more 
        nuanced understanding of the role played by international capital flows 
        in promoting development. It also contains some important implications 
        for the policy framework of developing countries. </p>
      <p>The study set out to answer the following three questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does financial globalization promote economic growth in developing 
          countries?<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>What is its impact on macroeconomic volatility in these countries?<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>What factors can help harness the benefits of financial globalization?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Economic theory states that developing countries can accrue large benefits 
        from financial integration. By opening their economies to capital inflows 
        such as foreign direct investment, portfolio investments, and bank borrowing, 
        countries not only encourage economic growth, they also help stabilize 
        consumption, which is an important measure of economic well-being.</p>
      <p>What the study found was that this theory doesn't always hold true in 
        practice. Even though income per capita is higher for developing countries 
        that have more open economies, it is difficult to find strong evidence 
        that suggests this is due to the fact that they have liberalized their 
        capital account. In fact, some of these countries have experienced very 
        costly banking or currency crises, when investors suddenly decided to 
        withdraw their money. </p>
      <p>However&#8212;and this is important&#8212;the study also found that once 
        financial integration crosses a certain threshold, the positive effects 
        of international capital flows (cheaper access to capital, transfer of 
        new technology, development of the banking system) begin to cancel out 
        the negative effects. Furthermore, countries with good economic policies 
        and low corruption stand to gain from financial integration. These countries 
        do a good job at attracting foreign direct investment, which is especially 
        conducive to economic growth. In contrast, countries that are perceived 
        by investors as lacking in transparency and/or as having poor economic 
        policies, tend to rely more on &quot;hot money&quot;, such as short-term 
        bank loans, and less on foreign direct investment. This makes them more 
        prone to crisis.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To give an example, financial integration can encourage countries to 
        overspend. Access to world capital markets makes it easier for governments 
        to borrow&#8212;often excessively and on a short term basis. The accumulation 
        of short-term debt in foreign currencies makes such countries more vulnerable 
        to external shocks or changes in investor sentiment. </p>
      <p>However, such risks offer reason to proceed with liberalization <i>carefully</i>; 
        they are not reasons for turning away from it altogether. The IMF continues 
        to believe that developing countries can reap significant advantages from 
        opening up to the outside world. In this respect, it is important to keep 
        in mind that this study looked at only one aspect of globalization&#8212;the 
        role played by international capital flows in the economic development 
        of developing countries. Other aspects of globalization, such as international 
        trade and labor mobility, were not included in the analysis. An overwhelming 
        majority of research papers have found that trade liberalization has a 
        positive effect on economic growth. The financial-liberalization study 
        therefore should not be seen as providing an answer to the broader question 
        of whether globalization is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; for developing 
        countries.</p>

      <p align="center"><i><a name="5"></a>Major Civil Society-IMF Dialogue</i></p>
      <p><b><i><a name="5a"></a>IMF staff meets World Council of Churches (WCC)</i></b></p>
      <p>Representatives of the IMF and World Bank and the World Council of Churches 
        sought common ground during a meeting in Geneva in February. Structured 
        as a seminar, the session included presentations and debates on growth 
        strategies and civil society's access to policymakers. </p>
      <p>One of the goals of the two-day meeting, and others planned to follow 
        over a two-year period, was to find points of common ground. The seminar 
        grew out of an exchange of letters aimed at establishing a high-level 
        dialogue last year between Horst K&ouml;hler, managing director of the 
        IMF; James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank; and the Rev. Dr. Konrad 
        Raiser, general secretary of the WCC.</p>
      <p>The discussions were broken down into four sessions covering the evolution 
        of the mandates of the Bretton Woods institutions and their views on development; 
        &quot;the International Concept of Wealth Creation and Social Justice&quot;; 
        privatization; and an assessment of the dialogue experience.</p>
      <p>Some criticism from the WCC side was unsparing. During the session on 
        wealth creation and social justice, Pamela Brubaker, a professor of Christian 
        Ethics at California Lutheran University, insisted that the economic policies 
        promoted by the Bretton Woods institutions have widened the gap between 
        the wealthy and the poor. She said she was not persuaded by recent changes 
        in their poverty reduction initiatives. In her view, the international 
        financial institutions are driven by the financial interests of a small 
        elite of corporations and major countries.</p>
      <p>But speaking at the same session, Peter Heller, Deputy Director of the 
        IMF Fiscal Affairs Department, responded by describing the way in which 
        the IMF has broadened its concern for poverty reduction and job creation 
        over the last 15 years. In the early 1990's, the Fund sought to ensure 
        that countries adopted policies to prevent adjustment policies from worsening 
        the situation of the poor, Heller said. Now, there is even more emphasis 
        on helping countries create jobs that can bring households out of poverty 
        and supporting policies that help the poor receive vital education and 
        health services, while still fostering growth and macroeconomic stability. 
        Heller emphasized that the poor are the principal beneficiaries of policies 
        to restrain inflation: unlike the rich and middle income groups, they 
        have no way of avoiding a loss in real income. He also noted that the 
        major shareholders of the Fund have strongly supported this change in 
        emphasis.</p>
      <p>Brian Ames, an Advisor in the IMF's Policy Development and Review Department, 
        updated the group on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process and 
        its potential for engaging civil society and broadening debate on key 
        issues of poverty. The same session heard a highly critical presentation 
        by Patrick Bond of the University of Witwatersrand on water privatization 
        issues in southern Africa.</p>
      <p>The consensus among seminar participants was that the WCC and the Bretton 
        Woods institutions have a common commitment to fighting poverty. But many 
        WCC members say they share the perception that they are excluded from 
        the process of defining development agendas.</p>
      <p>They also share an interest in keeping the dialogue going. A second seminar 
        is planned later this year in Washington. Topics will include the participatory 
        process as part of the PRSP; the roles of public and private sectors in 
        the economy; responses to globalization; and governance of the Bretton 
        Woods institutions and member nations. Some participant churches indicated 
        that in the future they plan to approach the dialogue by providing practical 
        suggestions and alternatives to combating poverty, and perhaps bringing 
        a different mix of participants to the event.</p>

      <p><b><i><a name="5b"></a>Managing Director meets World Vision president</i></b></p>
      <p>As part of a continuing series of meetings with NGOs that focus on the 
        work of the international financial institutions, IMF Managing Director 
        Horst K&ouml;hler met in February with Dean Hirsch, President of World 
        Vision International, a faith-based antipoverty and relief organization</p>
      <p>During the meeting, Hirsch emphasized that all sides in the IMF/CSO dialogue 
        need to engage constructively and openly as the Fund moves toward a more 
        transparent interaction with various groups.</p>
      <p>The meeting&#8212;which took place against the background of the publication 
        of the World Vision discussion document &quot;The IMF and Civil Society: 
        Deepening the Dialogue&quot; (available at <a href="http://www.globalempowerment.org/">www.globalempowerment.org</a>)&#8212;was 
        a step toward improving relations between the IMF and civil society. Admonished 
        in the past for ignoring its critics, the Fund now faces a different level 
        of scrutiny. Alan Whaites, World Vision's Director for Policy and Advocacy, 
        cautioned K&ouml;hler against treating outreach to NGOs as &quot;risk 
        management.&quot; He pointed out that some meetings between the IMF and 
        civil society have resulted in both sides &quot;talking past each other,&quot; 
        and urged the Fund to be more open to NGO views.</p>
      <p>K&ouml;hler said that the IMF sometimes serves as a lightning rod for 
        outrage about all that is wrong in the world, and suggested that complaints 
        about lack of access to the Fund sometimes ring hollow. He said that talking 
        to NGOs is now &quot;a way of life&quot; and described the External Relations 
        Department's <a href="032803.htm">current 
        effort</a> to assist Fund staff in developing civil society outreach (see 
        interview with Prof. Scholte on page 3). </p>
      <p>Hirsch said that in his role as President of the Global Movement for 
        Children, he is responsible for identifying ways to bring the international 
        financial institutions, the UN and other organizations together to help 
        children on issues including education and health. He suggested that through 
        this project he could find opportunities to urge the Fund's regular counterparts 
        to engage more openly. Hirsch also expressed interest in the Fund's work 
        on a review of the role of its resident representatives stationed overseas 
        in member countries.</p>

      <p><b><i><a name="6a"></a>Lucerne CIS-7 meeting</i></b></p>
      <p>The challenges facing the seven poorest members of the Commonwealth of 
        Independent States in their long transition toward economic development 
        were the focus of a January 2003 conference in Lucerne, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Officials of the CIS-7 (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, 
        Moldova, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) attended the conference along with 
        members of civil society from their own countries, officials of multilateral 
        organizations, donor countries and academics. Lively debates at each of 
        the sessions centered on the role of the international community during 
        the early part of the transition, the importance of country ownership, 
        and the need for improved cooperation in the region.</p>
      <p>The CIS-7 representatives said their countries had received valuable 
        financial support and technical assistance from the multilateral financial 
        institutions. But they also said the financing mix was too weighted toward 
        loans, arguing that the loan-grant imbalance occurred in part because 
        the time that it would take to lay the foundation for economic growth 
        had been underestimated. Marat Sultanov, a parliamentarian from the Kyrgyz 
        Republic, said that with only limited grant financing available, the countries 
        had little choice but to borrow in an attempt to prevent living standards 
        falling even more sharply than they did in the early years of the transition. 
        The bottom line, he said, was that the international community had helped 
        build debt as well as government institutions.</p>
      <p>The conference papers did not call for fundamentally different approaches 
        to transition. However, several country participants stressed that reforms 
        could only be implemented if they were &quot;owned&quot; by the country. 
        Yegor Gaidar, former Prime Minister of Russia and now director of the 
        Moscow-based Institute for the Economy in Transition, pointed out that 
        Russian tax reforms became reality only after Russian officials themselves 
        took the lead in designing the initiatives.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, there was consensus that, given their location and the 
        small size of their economies, the CIS-7 countries will need to focus 
        on expanding their trade. CIS-7 representatives agreed with this notion 
        and acknowledged that trade is heavily constrained by ad hoc tariffs, 
        transit restrictions, and border closures. But they also said that it 
        is essential to ensure improved access to industrial country markets, 
        especially in the EU.</p>
      <p>The conference ended on a relatively positive note. Despite the long 
        road ahead, the recent pickup in growth in most of the countries had resulted 
        in reductions in poverty rates suggesting that the countries were heading 
        in the right direction.</p>
      <p>All the papers from the conference are available at the <a href="http://www.cis7.org/">CIS-7 
        Initiative website</a>, in both English and Russian.</p>

      <p><b><i><a name="7a"></a>Susan Adams, Senior Resident Representative, IMF 
        Vietnam</i></b></p>
      <p>On March 12 I was invited to speak to the <b>Development Cooperation 
        Committee (DCC)</b> of Hanoi, comprised of NGOs and other members of civil 
        society. Vietnam has over 350 international NGOs, who are coordinated 
        in part by the <b><a href="http://www.ngocentre.netnam.vn/">Vietnam NGO 
        Resource Center</a></b>.</p>
      <p>I challenged the participants to &quot;connect the dots&quot; between 
        their efforts on the ground and the macro-policy focus of the IMF. The 
        game is to see in how many dots, or connections, a given NGO activity 
        can be linked with an IMF topic of interest. For example, several NGOs 
        in Vietnam are involved in rural micro-credits and micro-lending to small 
        businesses. While micro-lending is not a routine topic in the policy dialogue 
        of the IMF with the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), it is on the &quot;radar 
        screen&quot; now because the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Vietnam is 
        sponsoring a technical assistance project to write supervision manuals 
        for the SBV on micro-lending activities.</p>
      <p>Another example: a UNESCO team recently visited Vietnam to study the 
        potential for eco-tourism in Halong Bay (a natural wonder in the north 
        part of the country). The UNESCO representative started off by apologizing 
        for meeting the IMF, which he was sure had no interest in eco-tourism, 
        but was on the schedule of meetings anyway. To the contrary, we &quot;connected 
        the dots&quot; in three steps: one, eco-tourism is not only environmentally 
        important to all of us, but also helps generate tourism generally; two, 
        tourism has many linkages to economic development across sectors, generating 
        growth and poverty reduction; and three, tourism generates foreign exchange 
        earnings for Vietnam, which directly links to the reserves strength of 
        the State Bank of Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The bottom line: We are more connected to each other than we realize!</p>

      <p>Under the umbrella of the UN family, we participated in monthly meetings 
        of the Youth Initiative organized by various UN agencies. This project 
        aims at establishing the content and the form of the UN Youth Summit scheduled 
        for July 2003. The summit's aims include: empowering young people to gather 
        the skills necessary for participation in public life; equipping them 
        with the skills to work with government; encouraging the voices of young 
        people to be heard at all levels of decision-making; discussing the Millennium 
        Development Goals (MDG) in the framework of new legislation to be enacted 
        by the government; and including the voices of young people in this legislation 
        and policy development. </p>
      <p>In order to achieve these goals, the summit will serve not only as a 
        forum for discussion, but also as an organizing device for practical action 
        on a number of issues, including achieving progress toward the MDGs; encouraging 
        reproductive health and healthy lifestyles, family, health and responsible 
        male behavior; and eliminating the worst forms of child labor.</p>
      <p>We try to make sure that the relevant budgetary allocations&#8212;on 
        health and education, for instance&#8212;are being spent as intended and 
        that funding is adequate, given overall constraints. We also try to verify 
        that youth rights are respected in the newly adopted civil and economic 
        codes. More generally, together with other donors, we monitor whether 
        the authorities follow a public and transparent process when accounting 
        for the views of civil society on a wide range of policy issues.</p>

          the news that the IMF Managing Director has advocated strongly for the 
          two-pillar, Monterrey Consensus-based approach, and that the International 
          Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) supported the IMF's role in 
          helping poor countries meet the MDGs.<br>

          process has not been participatory and discussed ways to incorporate 
          CSO views in the future.</li>
