			<td><p align="center"><i><a name="P41_609"></a>Recent Developments in IMF-CSO
			      Relations</i></p>
			  <p>The 2004 IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings were the first for the IMF's
			    new Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato, who assumed his post in June. The
			    meetings also marked the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Bretton Woods
			    agreement on the founding of the IMF and World Bank. The meetings came
			    after a period of extensive travel by de Rato, including two visits to
			    Africa and one each to Latin America and Asia, that allowed him the opportunity
			    to hear wide ranging views on the global economy, issues facing developing
			    countries, and the role of the Fund.</p>
			  <p>In his <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2004/100304.htm">speech</a> to
			    the meetings, de Rato described his developing perspectives. On the question
			    of how to address the needs of the low-income countries, de Rato focused
			    on the Fund's core expertise-the provision of policy advice to achieve
			    macroeconomic stability-and on the need for increased trade liberalization,
			    particularly through the Doha round, and increased aid from the advanced
			    economies: </p>
			  <ul>
			    <p>We have seen encouraging results where such stability has been complemented
			      by structural reforms and by targeting public spending to areas of greatest
			      benefits to people. Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda have seen sustained
			      improvements in economic performance. Growth rates have also picked
			      up in other African countries that have made progress in curbing inflation
			      and establishing better control of the public finances. Where such improvements
			      in policymaking are evident, developed nations should fulfill their
			      end of the bargain by liberalizing trade and delivering aid. They should
			      improve access to their markets for developing countries' exports and
			      dismantle trade-distorting subsidies. There must also be increased aid,
			      not just for the countries under the HIPC Initiative but for others
			      as well. In some countries, we are indeed seeing larger inflows of foreign
			      assistance, including to combat HIV / AIDS. Other ideas for increasing
			      aid for low-income members, including deeper debt relief and increased
			      grant financing, are needed and welcome. The Fund is ready to help design
			      polices that would help countries make the most effective use of these
			      increased resources. Better aid coordination among donors, and multi-year
			      commitments, are also needed to make development assistance more effective.
			      But, first and foremost, we need to increase aid levels</p>
		      </ul>
			  <p>The Annual Meetings also offered the opportunity for representatives
			    of civil society organizations (CSOs) to sit down with staff members from
			    the Bank and the Fund to discuss a range of issues of mutual concern.
			    About 150 people from organizations in 30 countries attended the <a href="#P77_9505">civil
			    society dialogues</a>, including the second annual townhall meeting with
			    leaders of the two institutions. But recent contacts have not been confined
			    to the Annual Meetings. Immediately after that gathering, top officials
			    of the Fund and Bank met with representatives of the <a href="#P127_20817">international
			    labor movement</a>. Later in the month leaders of the Bretton Woods organizations
			    met with leaders of the <a href="#P56_3699">World Council of Churches</a> in
			    Geneva. </p>

			  <p><b><i><a name="P56_3699"></a>High-level meeting of the World Council
			        of Churches, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund</i></b></p>
			  <p>The first ever meeting of the leaders of the World Council of Churches
			    (WCC), IMF and World Bank took place on October 22 at WCC headquarters
			    in Geneva. The main speakers representing the three organizations were
			    World Bank President James Wolfensohn, IMF Deputy Managing Director Agust&iacute;n
			    Carstens, and WCC General Secretary Rev. Dr. Samuel Kobia. The meeting
			    was moderated by Cornelio Somarruga of the Caux Initiatives for Change
			    and former President of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
			    and also addressed by Dr. Agnes Abuom, President for Africa of the WCC.
			    IMF Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato was unable to participate in the
			    meeting because of an official commitment, but participated in a private
			    meeting earlier in the day with Kobia, Abuom, Wolfensohn, and Carstens.
			    The afternoon meeting, in which a number of other representatives of the
			    three organizations participated, followed several preparatory meetings
			    held since May 2002 (see Civil Society Newsletter <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/NP/EXR/cs/eng/2003/043003.htm#5a">April
			    2003</a> and <a href="021204.htm#P85_5557">February
			    2004</a>). The meetings were initiated after the management of the two
			    Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) expressed a wish to engage in dialogue
			    with the WCC to improve mutual understanding of the organizations' work
			    in development.</p>
			  <p>The meeting focused on establishing common ground for efforts to address
			    global poverty, and on exploring continuing areas of difference in approach
			    and views on development issues. The session concluded that the areas
			    of common ground are large and significant, and that the three institutions
			    should find more effective ways to work together in the future. There
			    was agreement that the dialogue process would continue, and that it would
			    focus in the period immediately ahead on case studies that could be expected
			    to clarify issues and specific topics that lend themselves to common action.</p>
			  <p>The meeting was characterized by a frank and generally positive exchange
			    of views. In his formal statement, Kobia stressed the issue of voice-in
			    his view the WCC has always represented the voiceless-and the need for
			    a world economy that places people at the center of development. Growth
			    is not enough, he said; we must deal also with the issues of inequality.
			    Kobia concluded by focusing on the issues of environmental protection
			    and the democratization in the BWIs. </p>
			  <p>Abuom said that poverty is caused by a failure of brotherly love in the
			    world. The WCC is concerned with the need to change the market system,
			    and has not succeeded in persuading the BWIs of this need. Increased trade
			    alone does not reduce poverty or improve equity, she said; there is a
			    need for redistributive measures, and the world needs just, participatory,
			    and sustainable communities. She criticized the BWIs as undemocratic:
			    with Africa having only two Executive Directors, the institutions are
			    essentially a platform for the industrial countries. Highlighting the
			    issues of human rights, she called on the BWIs to look more to their work
			    through a rights-based framework. In sum, she said, the dialogue must
			    continue.</p>
			  <p>Wolfensohn reiterated his deep conviction about the critical role of
			    religions in the issues of development. He said he has spent eight years
			    trying to build bridges with faith-based institutions. He highlighted
			    his concerns regarding the role of youth, gaps between rich and poor,
			    and too much focus on the short-term concerns of security versus the long-term
			    problems of poverty. We are, he stressed, facing a serious crisis of inaction
			    after so many promises and commitments. Wolfensohn said he was deeply
			    troubled by the WCC's 2002 publication &quot;Lead us not into Temptation&quot;,
			    which he said presented an inaccurate picture of the World Bank and its
			    mission, work and staff. He focused also on how the Bank approaches issues
			    of human rights-largely through its actions. He noted that the issues
			    of governance-representation and voice-in the BWIs were issues for the
			    shareholders, not for management. In concluding, he called for a two-year
			    amnesty between the WCC and the BWIs and a determination to work together
			    on the issues of poverty.</p>
			  <p>Carstens reviewed the mandate and role of the IMF, describing its work
			    in surveillance-the regular monitoring and consultation of each member
			    country's economy-and in managing crises. The IMF is charged partly with
			    helping governments to make difficult decisions in difficult times. He
			    noted misconceptions about its role and work. He discussed the Poverty
			    Reduction Strategy process and its origins. He emphasized the progress
			    made through the dialogue process as a result of the hard work of the
			    staffs of the three institutions. He saw much to be hoped for in the common
			    ground identified. </p>
			  <p>The ensuing discussion included some frank exchanges on governance of
			    the IFIs; the &quot;disciplinary role&quot; of the IMF; the role of the
			    Bank and Fund in dealing with indigenous peoples; and on innovative sources
			    of development financing. The conclusions focused on the importance of
			    using the MDG framework as a vehicle for mobilization and action. There
			    was also discussion of equity issues. Kobia and Abuom focused in their
			    concluding comments on the path traveled together and on the common cause
			    that linked the three institutions.</p>
			  <p>After the meeting, the leaders of the three organizations issued a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2004/pr04220.htm">joint
			      statement</a>, calling the discussions significant and useful. The statement
			      links to a more detailed paper on <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/docs/wcc102204.htm">Common
			      Ground and Differences of View between the Bretton Woods Institutions
			      (IMF and World Bank) and the World Council of Churches</a>, prepared
			      by the staff involved in the discussions. This innovative paper aims
			      to set out clearly areas of agreement and disagreement between the BWIs
			      and the WCC.</p>

			  <p><b><i><a name="P77_9505"></a>Civil society dialogues at the Annual Meetings</i></b></p>
			  <p>The civil society dialogues at the 2004 IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings
			    focused on the role of the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) in low-income
			    countries-in particular in facilitating debt relief and promoting debt
			    sustainability-and the status of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers
			    (PRSP) process. Many of the meetings were organized by the IMF and World
			    Bank, but several events were sponsored by CSOs. The highlight was a CSO
			    townhall meeting that brought together the heads of the IMF and World
			    Bank as well as the Chairmen of the Development Committee and the IMFC.
			    Participating were nearly 150 representatives of NGOs, labor unions, faith-based
			    groups, and foundations from over 30 countries, all of whom were accredited
			    to the 2004 Annual Meetings. The full list of dialogues as well as minutes
			    of most sessions will be available at <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/civilsociety">http://www.worldbank.org/civilsociety</a>. </p>
			  <p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
			  <p><b><i><a name="P83_10461"></a>Townhall meeting with CSOs</i></b></p>
			  <p>Most of the accredited CSO representatives participated in the September
			    30 <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2004/tr040930a.htm">townhall meeting</a> with
			    Gordon Brown, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer and Chairman of the IMFC;
			    Trevor Manuel, South Africa's Minister of Finance and Chairman of the
			    Development Committee; IMF Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato; and World
			    Bank President James Wolfensohn. This was de Rato's first meeting with
			    global CSOs, after meeting local CSOs on recent trips to Africa and Asia.
			    At last year's Annual Meetings in Dubai former Managing Director Horst
			    K&ouml;hler participated in a similar <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2003/tr092103a.htm">session</a>.
			    This year's meeting was chaired by Aruna Rao, Director of Gender at Work,
			    and Chair of the Board of Directors of CIVICUS.</p>
			  <p>Speaking first, Chancellor Brown said that if the Millennium Development
			    Goals (MDGs) are to be met, the international community will have to dramatically
			    increase the amount of development aid that is available in the next few
			    years. He said that on present trends, countries in sub-Saharan Africa
			    will achieve the MDGs only by the year 2130-115 years late. &quot;We must
			    find better methods of financing development aid so that the great combination
			    of economic development, trade, and development aid make it possible to
			    have a world economy working for all of the people all of the time,&quot; Brown
			    said.</p>
			  <p>If multilateral debt relief is to match bilateral debt relief, additional
			    money will have to be generated, he said, noting that the UK has suggested
			    that a revaluation of IMF gold reserves could take place again. He said
			    there is undoubtedly scope for action without affecting the integrity
			    of the IMF's reserves or the gold market. There can be a move forward
			    under the leadership of the World Bank and the IMF, if the member countries
			    have the will to do so, Brown concluded.</p>
			  <p>De Rato told CSOs that the IMF's gold reserves have been used as recently
			    as five years ago to generate funds, and that repeating that exercise
			    depends on the will of the IMF Executive Board and not of IMF management.
			    If the political will exists to use the gold, he said, the Fund would
			    find the technical means to achieve the objective. He told CSOs the IMF
			    has a close relationship with civil society and that the Fund needs a
			    regular exchange of views with CSOs to perform its responsibilities. Discussing
			    the IMF's involvement in poverty-reduction efforts and debt relief, de
			    Rato said one of the major challenges from the 2004 IMF-World Bank Annual
			    Meetings was for countries to step forward to increase aid-through some
			    of the new mechanisms that are being discussed, but also through traditional
			    channels.</p>
			  <p>Manuel told the meeting that South Africa's gold mining industry employs
			    tens of thousands of workers from South Africa and neighboring countries,
			    and it has experienced significant job losses. He insisted that South
			    Africa needs to be heard in any discussions on the sale or revaluation
			    of gold reserves. He said his concerns center less on prices than on volatility
			    that could cause job losses affecting poor countries. Answering a question
			    from Jubilee Iraq on the cancellation of odious debt, Manuel said the
			    issue is a very tough call. He asked who would make the determination
			    of whether debt is odious: if Iraq's debt is deemed odious, why would
			    that decision not apply also to the Democratic Republic of Congo? Manuel
			    said there should be rules on the issue that apply equally to all aspects
			    of the work of the Bank and the Fund and that do not create moral hazard.</p>
			  <p>James Wolfensohn said any fair assessment of the Bank's reaction to the
			    Extractive Industries Review of World Bank investments in oil, gas, and
			    mining will conclude that the Bank has come a very long way. He said a
			    campaign launched against the Bank has claimed that &quot;if you don't
			    do 100 percent, you're doing nothing&quot; and this is not right. The
			    Bank believes it would be wrong for the institution to withdraw from coal,
			    oil, and gas investments and has made a significant contribution to cleaning
			    up such projects. The Bank has an important influence on the projects'
			    environmental standards.</p>
			  <p>In response to a statement from the floor on voice and representation
			    in the BWIs, Manuel said the issue is &quot;an ongoing battle&quot; that
			    addresses a &quot;deficit of democracy&quot; in the institutions. Poor
			    countries are inadequately represented, and it has to be asked whether
			    the Bank and the Fund are part of the multilateral system or merely arrangements
			    between debtors and creditors.</p>
			  <p>Other topics raised in the Q&amp;A session included women's participation
			    and visibility in the MDGs; World Bank conditionality; CSO accreditation

			  <p><b><i><a name="P101_15133"></a>An update on the IMF's role in low-income countries</i></b></p>
			  <p>At a September 30 meeting on the IMF's role in low-income countries (LICs),
			    Policy Development and Review Department (PDR) Assistant Director Mark
			    Plant told CSOs that the right place to have a conversation between CSOs
			    and the government is in the participatory Poverty Reduction Strategy
			    Paper (PRSP) process. Plant said that a PRSP process ideally would lead
			    to a policy program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
			    (PRGF)-the IMF's low-interest lending facility for LICs- but that in reality
			    this sequence does not always occur. The goal remains, however, of better
			    aligning the two processes. </p>
			  <p>Participants in PRGF program negotiations (the IMF and the government),
			    he said, need a system under which discussions on the PRSP can inform
			    the preparation of the PRGF, which in turn can come back and inform subsequent
			    discussions on the PRSP. The Fund and Bank hope to make a move in that
			    direction, Plant said, by transforming the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/jsa/index.asp">Joint
			    Staff Assessment</a> (JSA) into the new Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN).
			    The JSAN is intended to provide advice and feedback from the Boards of
			    the Bank and Fund to the authorities on a country's poverty reduction
			    strategy, rather than making a snap judgment on whether or not PRSP was
			    a sound basis for offering concessional support. Plant stressed that the
			    Fund would now make its assessment of a country's macroeconomic framework
			    public, instead of making implicit criticism. A country's proposed macro
			    framework might be aspirational, but the Fund could observe that, in its
			    view, the framework was unattainable in, say the next two or three years,
			    and explain why. This would stimulate a debate that should be more fruitful
			    for all participants in the process. People on each side of the debate
			    would know exactly what the other side was thinking. The Fund's intention
			    is to put the participatory process where it belongs-in the PRSP-and at
			    the same time ensure the PRGF is sensitive to the agreements reached in
			    the participatory process.</p>
			  <p>A questioner from the floor noted that exactly five years have passed
			    since former Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a speech
			    at the 1999 Annual Meetings that it was time to respond to &quot;the cries
			    of the poor.&quot; The panel was asked whether the Fund has indeed responded
			    to such pleas. Another questioner asked whether the IMF is really a pro-poor
			    institution if it took the Fund five years to make statements of commitment
			    to LICs and to include poverty and social impact assessments (PSIAs) in
			    the Fund's work. Staff at the meeting noted that programs supported by
			    the IMF now include such pro-poor elements as specified levels of social
			    or health spending; social components in national budgets; poverty targets;
			    and social goals. Also, the Fund now publicly counsels against wasteful
			    spending such as purchases of presidential jetliners. </p>
			  <p>Fiscal Affairs Department Deputy Director Peter Heller stressed that
			    although the IMF has been criticized as being overconcerned about inflation,
			    it is the poor who bear the worst effects of runaway price increases.
			    He said the IMF would not agree to 20 percent inflation, which would mean
			    prices doubling every three years. This is because the poor would be the
			    most affected, while those with assets or good incomes usually have hedges
			    against inflation.</p>

			  <p><b><i><a name="P127_20817"></a>IMF and World Bank meet with union leaders </i></b></p>
			  <p>IMF and World Bank management, Executive Directors and staff met with
			    leaders of the international labor movement on October 6-8 to discuss
			    a range of issues. The meeting in Washington, D.C. focused on efforts
			    to reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs);
			    there was also discussion of ways to enhance employment opportunities
			    and social inclusion, and reduce inequalities. The gathering was the second
			    in a biennial series instituted in 2002 (see <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/NP/EXR/cs/eng/2003/012303.htm#P68_5586">Civil
			    Society Newsletter January 2003</a>), and built upon a dialogue begun
			    more than a decade ago by the IMF's then Managing Director Michel Camdessus. </p>
			  <p>The labor union delegation included over 80 representatives of national
			    and international labor federations, which have nearly 200 million members.
			    It was headed by Guy Ryder, General Secretary of the International Confederation
			    of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and Willy Thys, General Secretary of the
			    World Confederation of Labor (WCL). Representatives from Global Unions
			    Federations and the OECD's Trade Union Advisory Committee also attended.
			    Willy Kiekens, IMF Executive Director from Belgium, whose constituency
			    includes several European countries, as well as Turkey and Kazakhstan,
			    chaired the main session held at IMF headquarters on October 7. The AFL/CIO
			    hosted the sessions held on October 6, and the World Bank those on October
			    8.</p>
			  <p>In his introductory remarks for the session at IMF headquarters, IMF
			    Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato welcomed the dialogue, noting that in
			    many countries organized labor is an important and sometimes indispensable
			    instrument for social change. In a world characterized by fast-moving
			    transformation, countries must adapt, he said. This often requires dealing
			    with such challenges as aging populations, the need to modernize labor
			    markets, and the liberalization of trading systems. The participation
			    of civil society-including labor unions, which are among the oldest and
			    most experienced contributors to the civic process-in these economic and
			    social debates can strengthen the consensus on difficult policy choices;
			    and the IMF has become increasingly aware of the importance of ownership
			    of economic policies. De Rato also observed that strong global expansions
			    such as the current one provide a timely opportunity to undertake reforms,
			    since changes in behavior are easier to bring about during economic recoveries. </p>
			  <p>The trade union delegation said that despite the IMF's upbeat assessment
			    of the global economy, most developing countries will fail to achieve
			    the MDGs by a wide margin. If progress toward these goals is to be accelerated,
			    the international community must take more ambitious steps on debt relief
			    and consider the various initiatives being proposed-including some form
			    of global taxation-to raise extra funding. They took note, however, of
			    de Rato's observation that the problem with obtaining new resources is
			    political, not technical. </p>
			  <p>The labor union leaders also stressed that poverty reduction depends
			    on implementing the right policies. In their view, the Bretton Woods Institutions'
			    emphasis on pro-growth, market-oriented economic liberalization is inadequate &quot;because
			    growth is not enough.&quot; They argued that too little attention is paid
			    to employment, wages, and social protection; growth must be accompanied
			    by &quot;decent&quot; job creation and an increase in social security
			    and justice. </p>
			  <p>The union representatives welcomed the more systematic consultations
			    taking place with local unions during the IMF's annual Article IV consultations
			    with individual countries, and on other missions. But they called for
			    greater involvement of local unions in the development of poverty reduction
			    strategies in low-income countries. IMF representatives pointed out that
			    the decision on whom to consult is made chiefly by governments. </p>
			  <p>Many union representatives said the Fund's recommendations to countries
			    on labor market reform remained a point of contention. They expressed
			    concern that the IMF calls for greater labor market flexibility regardless
			    of a country's circumstances. This, they said, tends to result simply
			    in deregulation and increased social insecurity. The union leaders urged
			    greater consultation with unions to promote a less disruptive restructuring
			    of the labor market.</p>
			  <p>The union leaders also met with World Bank president James Wolfensohn,
			    who emphasized that labor issues were central to development. He said,
			    for example, that the demographic challenge posed by one billion young
			    people worldwide entering the work force in the near future presents a
			    monumental opportunity-or risk of crisis. Creating productive employment
			    for this generation was key not only to growth, but also to stability
			    and hope, and thus ultimately to peace. On more specific points, Wolfensohn
			    reported that recent World Bank reports promote job creation above all
			    as the key to improving the business climate; and that core labor standards
			    (CLS) are now being promoted by the Bank, though not yet as conditions
			    in its lending. He also welcomed the report of the International Labour
			    Organization's (ILO) World Commission <a name="P143_25951"></a>on the
			    Social Dimension of Globalization for its contribution to global policy
			    discussions, noting the Bank's involvement in the production of the report
			    and its continued commitment to following up on its recommendations. </p>
			  <p>Topics discussed at sessions with staff included IFI policies and programs
			    on trade; Bank-Fund work in low-income countries; labor and employment
			    issues in PRSPs; incorporation of core labor standards into World Bank
			    lending; the report on the Social Dimension of Globalization; the World
			    Bank's approach to social protection; and trade union contributions to
			    meeting the MDGs. Union leaders also met separately with IMF and World
			    Bank Executive Directors.</p>
			  <p>A more complete summary record of the discussion will be released in
			    the coming months. </p>

			  <p align="center"><i><a name="P150_26743"></a>Letters from the Field:</i></p>
			  <p><b><i><a name="P153_26766"></a>Saturday with the survivors<br>
  Kenneth Meyers, former Rwanda Mission Chief (May 2001 - September 2004)</i></b></p>
			  <p>It was a sunny Saturday morning when we left Kigali's asphalt avenues,
			    and bounced for a few minutes across bone-dry, dirt roads to our destination.
			    Waiting for us was Jean Marie, the Secretary of the Fund for the Needy
			    Victims of Genocide and Massacres, with two young men and a young woman.
			    Our first stop was a settlement of 84 &quot;families&quot; (totaling some
			    400 young men and women) whose relatives, nuclear and extended, had been
			    destroyed in Rwanda's 1994 genocide, as had their hopes for a normal life.
			    The families were groupings of 6 to 8 teenagers, generally aged 15 to
			    18. Some of the families consisted of relatives (brothers, sisters and
			    cousins), while others had come together with necessity as the only guide. </p>
			  <p>We walked down the road to one of the houses. We were greeted by a young
			    girl sitting on a step, washing a blouse in a plastic bowl. Another housemate
			    joined us, then a few more, and we entered their home. It was sparse:
			    cinderblock walls, no lights (not even a candle), no curtains, and one
			    rudimentary chair. The two bedrooms were similarly spare-just a mattress
			    on the floor. We were told that this room could sleep five people, sleeping
			    waist up across the mattress. Jean&#160;Marie told us that this family
			    was lucky. They at least had a place to call home, a place where they
			    belonged. Ten years after catastrophe struck Rwanda 40,000 genocide survivors
			    still are living day to day with no permanent dwelling.</p>
			  <p>We spoke briefly with the head of the household that we were visiting.
			    He had finished a vocational training program but had been unable to find
			    work in the past year. When we asked how the family was able to feed itself,
			    we were told, &quot;with the help of God.&quot; It seemed that there was
			    a limit to their luck.</p>
			  <p>We stepped outside and talked with some of the neighboring families about
			    their hopes. &quot;We hope to finish school, to get professional training,
			    to enter the university, if it is possible,&quot; one person said. We
			    learned that for those lacking an education, there is little hope. Yet,
			    completing school is no easy task. Without electricity or a candle, the
			    children cannot study after nightfall. Since Kigali is at the Equator,
			    darkness arrives around 6:30 each evening. The teenage family heads do
			    their best, but life is hard for everyone, and the idea of a parent helping
			    the younger children with their homework was far removed from their experience.
			    There are no guarantees for those who do manage to graduate. We were introduced
			    to a young woman with a radiant smile who had recently received a degree
			    from a university in India. She said that she was worried. She had no
			    job prospects. Would she be able to find work? We all assured her that
			    she would succeed. No guarantees. </p>
			  <p>We said goodbye and set off to a block of buildings further down the
			    road. Here the Fund for Genocide Survivors had built simple homes for
			    widows of the 1994 killings. Some 800 widows and their children (some
			    natural and others acquired out of the moment's necessity) had been settled
			    here. The cinderblock homes, we were told, were put up quickly, and with
			    little supervision. Some of them appeared to be in poor condition; occupants
			    had obviously made improvements to others. We walked up to one of the
			    more attractive dwellings-the windows were curtained and its walls had
			    been painted-and were greeted by a mother. Unlike our previous encounter,
			    there was no warmth in this meeting. Civil, but with a stony stare, she
			    motioned to the small refuge that she had managed to put together. It
			    seemed clear that the dark nights of her past had stolen away more of
			    her life than she could bear. A small room had been turned into simple
			    store, selling soap and other sundries. The store also contained a water
			    tap, firmly secured by a lock. In this parched quarter piped water is
			    for those who can pay. An older widow whom we met on the road, leaning
			    wearily on a staff, explained that she had no family, and the walk to
			    the public water source, a kilometer away, had become a great strain.
			    We had entered the purgatory of the innocent.</p>
			  <p>The paralyzing spell of the moment was broken by the laughter of children.
			    Mostly ragged, they were, nonetheless, radiant. They spoke the universal
			    language of karate motions and happy cries. A discreet wave to a beaming
			    young boy was returned, timidly, in kind. The IMF mission team members
			    were an exciting curiosity. In this mostly barren world, novelty is entertainment.</p>
			  <p>When we retraced our steps back to Kigali later in the day, we carried
			    a new window onto a painful piece of humanity. In parting, Jean Marie
			    thanked us. Ten years on, he noted, the outside world had come to see
			    the survivors of the genocide as just another wave in the broad sea of
			    the disadvantaged. &quot;Please,&quot; he asked, &quot;help us to be remembered.&quot; </p>
			  <p><i><b>Editor's Note: </b>In the period following the 1994 genocide, the
			      IMF actively supported Rwanda in restoring macroeconomic stability and

			      to reestablish its macroeconomic institutions.</i></p>
