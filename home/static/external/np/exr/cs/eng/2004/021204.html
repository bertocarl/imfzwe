<p align="center"><em><a name="P45_645"></a>Recent Developments in IMF-CSO Relations</em>
<p><a name="P47_685"></a>The work of international institutions with civil society
  organizations (CSOs) often seems to focus on nongovernmental organizations.
  Indeed, the Fund staff who interact with CSOs&#8212;the country teams, the
  policy researchers, and external relations staff&#8212;devote considerable
  time to the essential exchange of views with NGOs. But other interlocutors
  are also important: elected representatives, religious organizations, and labor
  unions. This issue of the <i>Civil Society Newsletter</i> focuses on some of
  our ongoing activities with two of these groups. We offer an <a href="#P57_2447">overview</a> of
  a recently released IMF Executive Board <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ed/2004/ecnl/index.htm">study</a> of
  the Fund's growing outreach to parliamentarians. In addition, we offer an <a href="#P85_5557">article</a> on
  our continuing dialogue with the World Council of Churches; an <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/NP/EXR/cs/eng/2003/043003.htm#5a">article</a> on
  the first such meeting was published in the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/NP/EXR/cs/eng/2003/043003.htm">April
  2003 issue of the Civil Society Newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>We would also like to draw your attention to a new source of information on
  IMF perspectives on policies and country programs. In January, we posted on
  the Fund's external website (<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">www.imf.org</a>)
  a new feature called <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/qin/index.asp">Questions in
  the News</a> that provides the Fund response to questions raised by journalists
  and others about IMF policies and operations. At present, most of the material
  is drawn from press conferences, and, to broaden its coverage, readers of the
  Civil Society Newsletter are encouraged to send questions to <a href="mailto:inthenews@imf.org">inthenews@imf.org</a>. </p>
<p>As always, we welcome your comments and questions about the <i>Newsletter</i>.
  It is intended not just to offer the Fund's perspective on issues of interest
  to civil society, but to provide balance of views by presenting the criticisms
  we face in our outreach&#8212;to which we are attempting to respond constructively.</p>

<p><b><i><a name="P57_2447"></a>Enhancing IMF Parliamentary Outreach</i></b></p>
<p>In an effort to enhance its dialogue with legislators, the IMF is inviting
  public comment on the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ed/2004/ecnl/index.htm">report
  of the Working Group of IMF Executive Directors on Enhancing Communication
  with National Legislators</a>.</p>
<p>The Working Group was set up in May 2003 to examine how the IMF could enhance
  its dialogue with legislators. The report summarizes the Fund's past outreach
  to legislators, and the discussions and recommendations by the Working Group
  on future outreach.</p>
<p>The Working Group report stresses that IMF outreach should be a two-way dialogue
  and that it is important for the Fund to listen to legislators. Such dialogue
  is important to the Fund particularly because legislators in most countries
  have the constitutional responsibility to oversee national budgets and approve
  legislation on economic reforms. It provides the IMF with an opportunity to
  listen to the concerns of legislators&#8212;and thus the citizens they represent&#8212;and
  to improve the Fund's understanding of the political and social context in
  which economic policy decisions are taken. The Working Group, therefore, encouraged
  Executive Directors and staff to continue their outreach efforts.</p>
<p>The Working Group agreed that greater interaction between legislators and
  the Fund would be particularly beneficial to the IMF because it would help
  build understanding of economic reforms and IMF programs. It could also provide
  a useful avenue for informing and receiving comments from legislators about
  the work of the Fund and its role in the international financial system in
  general. </p>
<p>The Working Group's report invites comments on its recommendations to learn
  how the IMF can enhance its dialogue with legislators. The comments will be
  reviewed and will provide input via a weblink for the IMF's evolving outreach
  to national legislators.</p>
<p><b>IMF's Outreach to Legislators</b></p>
<p>The IMF's dialogue with national legislators, which has expanded in recent
  years, takes a number of forms:</p>
<ul>
  <li> IMF management, Executive Directors, and staff meet with legislators on
    their visits to member countries and when legislators visit Washington.<br>
          <br>
  </li>
  <li>At seminars in Zambia, Indonesia, Kenya, Cameroon, Ghana, and Southeast
    Asia, IMF staff and legislators have discussed the country's poverty reduction
    strategies, IMF-supported programs, and the role and activities of the IMF.<br>
            <br>
  </li>
  <li>Training has been provided at the IMF's Joint Vienna Institute for legislators
    from the transition economies of central and eastern Europe, since 1995.<br>
          <br>
  </li>
  <li>The IMF has participated in the annual conferences, field visits, and regional
    East Africa chapter of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank. At the
    network's 2003 annual conference, IMF Managing Director Horst K&ouml;hler
    engaged in an hour-long Q&amp;A session with legislators (see <i><a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/2003/033103.pdf">IMF
    Survey</a></i>, March 31, 2003)<br>
                <br>
  </li>
  <li>IMF staff have attended conferences and meetings of the Inter-Parliamentary
    Union , collaborated with the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against
    Corruption, and organized meetings for legislators in Washington with the
    Canadian Parliamentary Center.</li>

<p><b><i><a name="P85_5557"></a>Continued dialogue with the World Council of
      Churches</i></b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wcc-coe.org/">World Council of Churches (WCC)</a> representatives
  visited Washington last October for the second meeting with IMF and World Bank
  staff in the past year. The encounter was part of a dialogue that was launched
  in Geneva in February 2003 (see <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/NP/EXR/cs/eng/2003/043003.htm#5a">Civil
  Society Newsletter, April 2003</a>) and aimed at finding common ground on crucial
  global issues. It also is aimed at clearing the way for a high-level meeting,
  tentatively planned for later this year. The gathering covered four topics
  that emerged from the Geneva discussion: institutional governance and accountability;
  participation of civil society in development; the respective roles of the
  public and private sectors in poverty reduction; and the challenges of globalization. </p>
<p>The meeting provided an opportunity to exchange views. Although some of the
  discussion was contentious, it also revealed considerable common ground among
  the three institutions, particularly on the objectives of policy. WCC team
  members voiced their perception that the World Bank and IMF are strongly influenced
  by the &quot;neo-liberal paradigm&quot; and dominated by major shareholders.
  Voting power should be reallocated, they said, to ensure that the institutions
  represent the interests of the whole membership. IMF staff responded that both
  institutions reflect much greater diversity and pragmatism than this perception
  suggests.<s> </s>Moreover, both institutions serve a universal membership with
  a sophisticated system of consensus and coalition-building in which developing
  countries are able to influence policies and loan decisions regardless of their
  formal voting rights. </p>
<p>The WCC also argued that the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) do not pay
  adequate attention to the economic and social consequences of their policy
  advice in poor member countries and questioned how seriously the institutions
  view the agenda regarding the participation and engagement of civil society
  in the development process. Bank and Fund staff said that the Poverty Reduction
  Strategy Paper (PRSP) process, which is central to the BWIs' involvement in
  low-income countries, involves substantial participation by civil society and
  aims to directly address these concerns about engagement. WCC staff suggested
  that the PRSPs could help promote democratic practices in countries.</p>
<p>The greatest headway in dialogue and understanding appeared to be achieved
  during the debate over the roles of the public and private sectors. The WCC
  speakers said that the BWIs too often advocate privatization and market mechanisms
  without adequate consideration of justice, equity, and the welfare of the poor.
  But there was broad agreement among the three organizations that social services
  are a basic human right and therefore a responsibility of the state. There
  was disagreement, however, over how these services should be provided, with
  World Bank and IMF staff urging an appropriate balance between public and private
  sectors to ensure the effective delivery of better services. </p>
<p>WCC, IMF and World Bank staff agreed that economic globalization has not benefited
  all people equally and has produced both winners and losers. IMF staff said
  that particularly in the opening of financial markets countries should take
  a gradual approach, and that policies were needed to help those who &quot;lose
  out&quot;. WCC staff questioned links between poverty reduction, economic growth,
  and trade expansion. They argued for giving greater prominence to human rights
  issues in trade, as well as for a more disaggregated approach that would highlight
  the negative impact of trade expansion on specific countries and groups of
  people.</p>
<p>At the end of the two-day meeting, the three delegations agreed to focus at
  the next meeting (planned for May 2004) on PRSP case studies and on planning
  issues for the high level meeting, tentatively planned for late 2004.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<p><b><i><a name="P99_9452"></a>The IMF at the European Social Forum</i></b></p>
<p>Klaus Enders, Assistant Director of the IMF Offices in Europe, participated
  in a seminar and a televised debate organized by the <a href="http://www.bridge-initiative.org/">Bridge
  Initiative on Globalization</a> on the margins of the <a href="http://www.fse-esf.org/">European
  Social Forum (ESF)</a>, which took place November 12-15 in Paris. </p>
<p>It was the third time that IMF staff have participated in a dialogue moderated
  by the Bridge Initiative, an effort initiated in 2000 by independent media
  producers in Europe and North America to help stakeholders with conflicting
  perspectives on globalization issues find agreement on substantive changes
  in policy that make the process more equitable. The group has hosted a series
  of seminars and televised debates between well-known CSO, business, and IFI
  leaders. </p>
<p>The Bridge seminar on November 11 and 12 discussed the future of multilateralism
  and the global effort to reduce poverty. Participants included representatives
  from a range of NGOs, French government officials, and representative from
  the UN, World Bank, OECD and the EU. Given the broad nature of the issues,
  the meeting was largely confined to broad statements and did not identify concrete
  actions, as the organizers had hoped to do. Most of the NGOs focused on proposals
  for radically changing the present &quot;system&quot; as opposed to ideas for
  incremental reform. Many rejected IMF-supported policies and saw no change
  in what they described as the Fund's failed dogma of &quot;neo-liberal&quot; economic
  development policies. </p>
<p>Despite the fundamental differences, the discussions were cordial and well
  coordinated. There was recognition that mankind faces urgent threats, such
  as poverty, and that meetings like those organized by the Bridge Initiative
  were useful to allow each side to take a look at issues from a less familiar
  perspective. As one civil society participant put it, &quot;it is quite useful
  to spend up to ten percent of one's time talking to the other side.&quot;</p>
<p>The public debate on November 13 was organized as part of the ESF's &quot;tables
  of controversy,&quot; the first time that the IMF was invited to the gathering.
  In addition to Enders, the panel consisted of Susan George (ATTAC), Jose Bove
  (French farmer and unionist), Njoki Njoroge Njehu (50 Years Is Enough Network)
  and Mats Karlsson (World Bank), and had an audience of 200 as well as a heavy
  media presence. The debate covered similar ground as the seminar. In addition,
  Bove argued that northern and southern small farmers have a common interest
  in preserving national agriculture; he called for a moratorium for multilateral
  liberalization in this area. Enders countered that such a moratorium is a disservice
  to farmers in developing countries for whom market opening in rich countries
  is an important vehicle to develop and to overcome poverty, especially when
  combined with reforms to strengthen governance in their own countries.</p>
<p>The tone of the debate was civil, with the audience clearly favoring the positions
  of CSO representatives. Regardless of their differing views, several participants
  expressed appreciation that the IMF and the World Bank had sent staff to participate.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<p><b><i><a name="P115_12578"></a>Oxfam UK Director Meets IMF Managing Director</i></b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/">Oxfam UK</a> Director Barbara Stocking
  and IMF Managing Director Horst K&ouml;hler met in December for the second
  time, resuming their discussion on how to improve the work of the Fund in low-income
  countries (LICs). Ms. Stocking and Mr. K&ouml;hler differed on a number of
  issues, but their lively meetings show a common concern for the issues at stake.
  As during their first meeting in December 2001, a major topic of discussion
  was trade, where there was an agreement on the need to open up the markets
  of rich countries and substantially reduce their subsidies of agricultural
  products.</p>
<p>Ms. Stocking said she recognized Mr. K&ouml;hler's genuine commitment to LICs,
  and that there have been some real changes in IMF policies. However, she felt
  the gap between policies and actual practice is large, and although the Fund
  is becoming more poverty focused, it is moving very slowly. Other concerns
  also remain, she noted, presenting the findings of the Oxfam paper <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/eng/policy_pape_imf_mdgs.htm">&quot;The
  IMF and the Millennium Development Goals: Failing to deliver for low income
  countries.&quot;</a> She focused on two issues: the lack of fiscal flexibility
  in IMF-supported programs and the concern about what the paper terms &quot;aid
  pessimism&quot;. She encouraged the Fund to be more positive about aid, where
  appropriate. She also said Fund assessments should take into account more than
  just macroeconomic stability; that they should include long-term plans for
  poverty reduction as well as the short term macroeconomic conditions. </p>
<p>Mr. K&ouml;hler said he appreciated the acknowledgment of the IMF's enhanced
  efforts to improve its role in LICs. He explained that the strategy is based
  on three elements: 1) the Millennium Development Goals; 2) the Monterrey consensus
  and the two-pillar approach (country-owned domestic frameworks and policies,
  and an enabling international environment); and 3) the constant refinement
  of the PRSP/PRGF process (presently under <a href="#P136_16758">IEO</a> review)
  and the PSIA approach. </p>
<p>He added that the IMF must have a firm line on macroeconomic stability, but
  that expressing concerns about macroeconomic instability that might arise from
  possible increases of aid inflows does not mean that the IMF is opposed to
  increasing development assistance. He added that the truth is that rich countries
  are not moving fast enough to change policies that would have a positive effect
  on poor countries. At the same time, poor countries are still not implementing
  policies that would promote poverty reduction. </p>

<p><b><i><a name="P129_15114"></a>Poverty Reduction Conference in Cambodia</i></b></p>
<p><b>Phnom Penh - </b>The Second East Asia and Pacific Conference on Poverty
  Reduction Strategies<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2003/pr03173.htm"> took place</a> on
  October 16-18, with representatives of 11 low-income countries participating.
  The conference was cosponsored by the IMF, the World Bank, the United Nations
  Development Program and the Asian Development Bank. As with past conferences
  involving countries that have prepared a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP),
  the most valuable aspect was the exchange of experiences and ideas among the
  representatives of low-income countries, with the mix of government officials,
  CSO representatives, and donors enriching the dialogue.</p>
<p>While there was broad acceptance of sound macroeconomic frameworks as a prerequisite
  for growth and poverty reduction, there were repeated calls for more fiscal
  flexibility to implement PRSPs and for more aid. There was also an emphasis
  on the need to deal with economic shocks. The session on the forthcoming <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2003/072103.htm">LIC
  paper</a> turned out to be largely informative for the delegates, particularly
  local representatives of various donors. Several speakers asked about the need
  for continued Fund engagement in LICs, questioning how it is decided that engagement
  continues. The issue of dialogue on macroeconomic issues in the PRSP was also
  raised, with delegates favoring a less secretive approach on the part of the
  Fund.</p>
<p>The countries participating in the conference were Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao
  People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Timor Leste, and Vietnam; as well as
  five observer countries&#8212;Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea,

<p><b><i>A Meeting with CSO Representatives on the IEO Work Program</i></b></p>
<p>On January 8, 2004 the Director of the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/index.htm">Independent
    Evaluation Office</a> (IEO), <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/bio/eng/msa.htm">Montek
    Singh Ahluwalia</a>, and IEO senior staff met representatives from CSOs to
    discuss the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/2003/wp/wpdp.htm">IEO work program</a> for
    the IMF's financial year beginning May 1 and progress with the evaluation
    of the PRSP and PRGF initiatives. Among the organizations participating were
    Friends of the Earth, ICFTU/Global Unions, New Rules for Global Finance,
    International Budget Project, Religious Working Group on the World Bank and
    IMF, and World Vision International. </p>
<p>Mr. Ahluwalia presented the IEO's current thinking on the projects in the
  work program and sought to gather CSOs' views in order to form a final judgment
  on how to sequence the IEO's evaluation efforts. CSOs represent an important
  part of the IEO's audience, as its <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/tor.htm">terms
  of reference</a> state that one of its responsibilities is to create a better
  understanding of Fund activities among a broader group of stakeholders. While
  the CSO representatives at the meeting said that all of the projects were opportune
  and valuable, they gave particular support to those related to structural conditionality,
  capital account liberalization, and the experience with Fund program involvement
  in crises that did not involve the capital account. Questions were raised regarding
  the IEO's operations and mandate, and the limitations the office faces evaluating
  Fund policy formulation in current program cases. (The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/2003/wp/wpdp.htm">work
  program</a> was posted on the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/index.htm">IEO website</a> for
  public comments in October 2003.)</p>
<p>The discussion of the IEO evaluation of the PRSP and PRGF initiatives included
  the nature and timing of the project and messages that the evaluation had started
  to distill. Meeting participants were briefed on an outreach/consultation event
  scheduled to take place in mid-January in Addis Ababa. That session was intended
  to receive feedback from various stakeholders (both government and civil society)
  primarily representing countries that are included in the evaluation as case
  studies. Questions and comments included issues of PSIA, PRGF linkage to PRSP,
  opening of the policy space to alternative options, and PRSP principles and
  political processes. (The<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/2002/prsp/index.htm"> issues
  paper for the PRSP/PRGF evaluation</a>, available on the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/index.htm">IEO
  website</a>, gives the list of the countries for which case studies are being
  undertaken.)</p>
<p>CSO participants expressed interest in IEO outreach activities. IEO staff
  said that several events have already been conducted, and outreach efforts
  were expected to intensify as more evaluation projects reach completion in
  the near future. A variety of venues in different countries have been used
  to disseminate the messages that have emerged from completed projects, and
  to present progress and seek feedback with on-going evaluations. </p>
<p>Mr.&#160;Ahluwalia emphasized the IEO's interest in receiving suggestions
  from CSOs on possible future evaluation on a more continuous basis and also
  in receiving substantive inputs relevant to ongoing evaluations. It was noted
  that contributions had been received from several CSOs for the PRSP/PRGF study. </p>

<p><b><i><a name="P154_19954"></a>Regional visits in Belarus</i></b><br>
<b><i>Zuzana Brixiova, Resident Representative</i></b></p>
<p>In Belarus, the economy remains predominantly state-owned, with only about
  20 percent of GDP produced in the private sector. To understand the economic
  situation outside Minsk, and especially conditions under which the private
  sector in Belarus operates, our office undertook&#8212;together with the senior
  officials of the National Bank of Belarus (the most reform-minded state institution)&#8212;several
  regional trips. </p>
<p>In the early 2003, we visited the Brest region. We met the officials from
  the Brest branch of the National Bank and local government, the Free Economic
  Zone (FEZ) &quot;Brest,&quot; Priorbank (one of the largest private banks in
  Belarus), and entrepreneurs outside of the FEZ. I was hoping to hear about
  some of the obstacles to private sector development, and also to visit enterprises
  that prosper regardless. We heard from the entrepreneurs about the obstacles
  only informally, when the government officials were absent. Excessive state
  intervention, cumbersome licensing procedures, complicated taxation, an unstable
  legal framework and limited access to credit were the most common concerns.
  Regarding prosperous enterprises, we were impressed by the joint Belarusian-German
  enterprise Santa Bremor operating in the FEZ Brest, which processes and sells
  fish products. It has substantial foreign investment, covers more than half
  of the Belarus fish market, and exports to several countries, including Russia,
  Ukraine, Germany, and Netherlands. Representatives of the Association of Entrepreneurs
  in Minsk (who usually are critical) are convinced that this enterprise is not
  under an official &quot;umbrella,&quot; but prospers due to the use of modern
  technology and good management practices. For a number of years now this enterprise
  has been considered a &quot;success case.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of 2003, we visited three private enterprises in Vitebsk. Two of
  them (a shoe producer and a farm, both with majority Belarusian private ownership)
  were operating outside of the FEZ, while one enterprise (a wholly-owned German
  chocolate producer) was in the FEZ. From discussions with managers as well
  as with the representatives of the NBB Vitebsk and the local state committee,
  it became clear that enterprises operating outside of the FEZ are under very
  close state inspection. Unsurprisingly, their managers listed excessive state
  interventions and cumbersome licensing procedures as the main obstacles to
  their activities. For example, the manager/owner of the farm (employing about
  50 people) explained that he is obliged to sell the unprocessed milk to state
  enterprises at a very low price (set by the state) because he cannot obtain
  a license to process the milk. The enterprise in the FEZ was also recently
  subject to ad hoc state intervention: the government tried to suggest that
  Russia (the main export country for this enterprise) is not a foreign territory
  and hence the company should search for other markets or to pay taxes. Still,
  the issue has been resolved and the enterprise continues to export to Russia
  under the FEZ tax privileges. </p>

<p><b><i><a name="P167_23158"></a>An Update from the Western Hemisphere Department</i></b></p>
<p>Edited by Leonardo Cardemil, Advisor, Western Hemisphere Department</p>
<p>In the context of a staff visit, last December the Chilean team met representatives
  of labor unions in Santiago, <b>Chile</b>. The union representatives expressed
  concern that recent labor flexibility law initiatives, including those in the
  government's Pro-Growth Agenda, had gone too far - that they represent only
  business interests and limit the contractual basis for employment. While acknowledging
  that poverty had declined over the past decade or so, they observed that income
  inequality remains high. </p>
<p>During 2003, staff had the opportunity to meet several representatives of
  CSOs in <b>Honduras</b>. These meetings were useful to assess advances in the
  National Dialogue and the Fiscal Responsibility Pact (two instruments linked
  to the PRSP participatory process through which the government pursued a broad
  dialogue on national issues), and to exchange views with different segments
  of society. Staff was able to listen to the views of teachers' unions, workers'
  unions, religious leaders, businessmen, farmers, women CSOs, among others.
  These groups were very appreciative of the Fund's efforts to meet with them
  and listen to their concerns. Moreover, they largely agreed with the Fund on
  the need for sound fiscal policies and a stable macroeconomic environment.
  Moreover, they were vocal about the limited success in reducing poverty and
  stressed that to avoid social disruption, the needed adjustment should be gradual
  and the burden should be shared by all members of society. The authorities
  anchored their fiscal program on the results of the Fiscal Responsibility Pact.</p>

<ul>
  <li> On October 21, the IMF office in Paris hosted a small lunch for CSOs on
    the <b>role of the Fund in Low-Income Countries</b> with Mark Plant, Assistant
    Director, Policy Development and Review Department (PDR). Representatives
    of the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs also attended. The meeting
    was part of the continued <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2003/072103.htm">LIC
    paper</a> outreach effort, launched at the Dubai Meetings.<br>
                              <br>
  </li>
  <li>On October 23, Mark Plant also met with a small group of NGOs in London
    as part of the LIC paper outreach. The meeting was organized by the External
    Relations Department (EXR) in cooperation with <b>Oxfam</b> and chaired by <b>Christian
    Aid</b>. In addition to the Fund presentation of the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2003/072103.htm">LIC
    paper</a>, Oxfam presented its <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/eng/policy_pape_imf_mdgs.htm">paper</a> on
    the Fund's contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).<br>
                                  <br>
  </li>
  <li>Staff from the IMF's United Nations Office (UNO) and EXR participated in
    informal hearings of civil society and business that were held in preparation
    for the <b><i>UN High Level Dialogue on Financing for Development</i></b>,
    October 27-28, 2003. Given the wide scope of the Monterrey Consensus, including
    a number of policy issues that fall under the Fund's mandate, this was an
    opportunity to reach out to CSOs and share information about Fund policies
    and the response to the Monterrey Conference. Most importantly, it was an
    opportunity for UN delegates and representatives of international institutions
    to listen to the concerns of CSOs.<br>
                          <br>
  </li>
  <li>Reinhard Munzberg, Director of the IMF's UNO, addressed the <b>Annual Parliamentary
      Hearing</b> at the UN on October 27. Over 120 legislators from 42 national
      parliaments and two regional parliamentary organizations participated in
      the event. The meeting was also attended by senior UN officials, members
      of the diplomatic community in New York, and representatives of other international
      organizations. The topics addressed by the parliamentarians included: follow-up
      to the Monterrey Conference; the role of the Bretton Woods institutions
      in the international financial architecture; breaking the world trade deadlock
      after Cancun; and unleashing its potential for development financing. For
      the Fund, the meeting was an opportunity to explain recent developments,
      in particular, the outcomes of the 2003 Dubai Annual Meetings and the Fund's
      involvement with parliamentarians. Relevant website: <a href="http://www.ipu.org/splz-e/unga03.htm">http://www.ipu.org/splz-e/unga03.htm</a> <br>

  <li>At the United Nations Online Network in Public Administration and Finance
    (<b>UNPAN</b>) <i>5<sup>th</sup> Global Forum on Reinventing Government</i> in
    Mexico City, November 3-7, IMF staff took part in a workshop on <i>Fiscal
    Transparency: ROSCs and Other Tools for Promoting Continuing Fiscal Management
    Reform.</i> The workshop examined the role of the IMF fiscal transparency
    code and fiscal transparency Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes
    (ROSCs) in promoting better fiscal and financial management. <br>
                          <br>
  </li>
  <li> IMF and World Bank staff met representatives of the <b>international labor
      movement</b> on November 5 for a follow-up to last year's high-level meeting
      (see <a href="../2003/012303.html">Civil Society
      Newsletter, January 2003</a>). The agenda focused on concrete developments
      since last year's meeting, on issues such as poverty reduction, reform
      of the international financial architecture, and ways to enhance the dialogue
      between labor unions and the Bretton Woods institutions. <br>
                                  <br>
  </li>
  <li>On November 19, Mark Plant participated in a panel discussion organized
    by <b>InterAction</b> on the role of the Fund in Low-Income Countries, another
    in the series of outreach events related to the LIC paper. Other panelists
    represented <b>Friends of the Earth</b> and <b>Oxfam International</b>. The
    discussion was chaired by InterAction. About twelve Washington-based NGO
    representatives were present. Patricia Alonso-Gamo, recently appointed chief
    of PDR's PRGF division, also attended.<br>
                            <br>
  </li>
  <li>On November 20, Axel Palmason of the IMF's UNO, led a round table discussion
    on implementation of the MDGs entitled <i>The Nexus between the Implementation
    of the Monterrey Consensus and Meeting the MDGs</i>. The event was organized
    by the <b>World Federation of United Nations Associations</b>. Around 60
    people, including diplomats, NGO representatives, and UN Secretariat staff
    attended. The Fund's support for the MDGs and the Monterrey Consensus was
    of great interest to participants in this context. <br>
                            <br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="P191_29318"></a>Elliott Harris, Advisor, PDR, participated in
    the <b>Eurodad Annual Conference</b> on the theme <i>Ideology and Evolving
    Acronyms: Progress or Doublespeak?</i> held in Prague, November 30-December
    2. Over 90 participants from civil society organizations had a discussion
    of each of the key development initiatives, several of which were discussed
    in more detail in workshops.<br>

  <li>The IMF begins on February 9 the regular publication of a weekly calendar
    of its Executive Board to enhance public access to information about the
    operations of the Fund. The Executive Board is responsible for overseeing
    the day-to-day activities of the Fund on behalf of its member countries.
    The weekly calendar, which will be updated regularly, contains the tentative
    schedule of formal meetings and Board seminars. The Board's agenda is typically
    finalized the day prior to each meeting, so the calendar is therefore tentative.
    Nevertheless, the calendar provides the latest available information on the
    Executive Board's scheduled activities. To view the calendar, visit the IMF's

    The Executive Board approved the release of its calendar as part of the latest
    review of the IMF's transparency policy, which was completed in September
    2003 (See <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2003/pn03122.htm">Public Information
