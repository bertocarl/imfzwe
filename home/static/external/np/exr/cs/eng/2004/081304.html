			  <p>Since the <a href="051704.htm">last issue</a> of
			    the Civil Society Newsletter, <a href="../../../../omd/bios/rrf.html">Rodrigo
			    de Rato</a> has taken up office as head of the IMF. The new Managing Director,
			    who previously served as Finance Minister of Spain, was appointed in May
			    after the resignation of Horst K&ouml;hler, who has since been elected
			    President of Germany. De Rato assumed his post on June 7, and immediately
			    set out to familiarize himself with the institution, and to meet with
			    leaders in member countries. This has involved a busy early travel schedule,
			    and de Rato initiated his contacts with civil society organizations (CSOs)
			    while overseas. Immediately after arriving in Washington, the Managing
			    Director visited Japan, China, Singapore, and Vietnam; in the last country
			    he held a <a href="#p5a">meeting</a> with international and domestic
			    NGOs, reported in this issue. In early August, he made his first trip
			    to Africa as head of the Fund, visiting Nigeria, Gabon, Uganda, and Kenya.
			    The visit involved wide-ranging exchanges of views related to the strategies
			    for promoting faster economic growth and poverty reduction in the region;
			    meetings with civil society organizations were held in each country. In
			    a speech to West African leaders in Gabon, de Rato said the Fund's African
			    Department is being restructured with more staff added, to ensure that
			    the institution is &quot;a reliable partner for Africa.&quot; He added
			    that &quot;a process of reflection is currently under way assessing the
			    IMF's work with its low-income members.&quot; In the weeks before the
			    October 2004 Annual Meetings, de Rato will continue reaching out to CSOs
			    worldwide.</p>
			  <p>Over the past few months, pressure has been increasing on the international
			    community to make good on its commitments to assist the poor countries-especially
			    in Africa-as they battle the scourge of HIV/AIDS. The IMF has welcomed
			    an emerging commitment by donors to provide more resources to combat the
			    disease; the Fund is working with recipient countries to help them make
			    the best possible use of the new resources. Over the next several years,
			    funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment is expected to rise dramatically.
			    But such rapid increases in external funding are not always an unmixed
			    blessing: they can pose serious challenges for countries seeking to absorb
			    the added resources effectively. If these challenges are not met, they
			    could not only compromise the expected benefits but also endanger longer-term
			    political support in donor countries. An <a href="#p2a">interview</a> in
			    this issue with a senior Fund staffer outlines many of the issues faced
			    by developing countries in using these resources. It also addresses-and
			    refutes-recent accusations that IMF-supported programs have restricted
			    individual countries' responses to the crisis.</p>

			  <p><b><i><a name="p2a" id="p2a"></a>An interview with Peter Heller on financing
			        for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment</i></b></p>
			  <p><i>Peter Heller, Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department of
			      the IMF, is a long-standing expert on the economics of health care in
			      developing countries. A former member of the World Health Organization's
			      Commission for Macroeconomics and Health and a current member of the
			      Task Force on Poverty and Economic Growth of the UN Millennium Project,
			      Heller recently organized a meeting of IMF staff with representatives
			      of the international health community, bilateral donors, and NGOs on
			      how to manage the macroeconomic implications of the new flow of assistance
			      for programs focused on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment (see<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/2004/071204.pdf"> article
			      in the IMF Survey</a>, p. 202). He spoke about the challenges involved,
			      at IMF Headquarters in Washington DC in July. Excerpts: </i></p>
			  <blockquote>
                <p><b>Q: Is there any legitimate criticism of the IMF in its
                    dealings with poor countries facing vast HIV/AIDS infection
                    rates?</b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: I don't think so. There is certainly no IMF ceiling
                  that has prevented the employment of nurses in Kenya or Uganda
                  or elsewhere, as has been alleged by some. It is true that
                  in these countries we are supporting programs in which there
                  are ceilings on domestic bank borrowing by the government that
                  effectively limit the size of the government budget deficit.
                  Very occasionally, there are ceilings that affect total government
                  employment. But if governments say, &quot;We can't employ people
                  in health care because the IMF is preventing us,&quot; that's
                  not really true. First, ceilings that may affect government
                  employment relate to <i>total</i> government employment. Governments
                  generally recognize that there are significant inefficiencies
                  and excesses in many ministries. Substitution of health workers
                  or teachers in place of administrators or clerks could, under
                  many circumstances, be a productive change. But we recognize
                  that this is not so simple for governments to do. And second,
                  if new resources <i>do</i> come in for HIV/AIDS, especially
                  in the form of grants, there is always scope for these ceilings
                  within Fund programs to be reconsidered. Supplementary budgets
                  can be passed that take account of new budgetary resources,
                  so these ceilings should not be a binding constraint preventing
                  employment for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. I should
                  also note that in some countries, the Fund has made explicit
                  provision for increasing the size of the civil service to accommodate
                  more teachers and health professionals. </p>
                <p><b>Q: Still, the IMF does enforce spending limits.</b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: Our core mandate is to help countries achieve and
                  maintain macroeconomic stability. That doesn't mean we're not
                  flexible. It does mean that we can't support a policy program
                  that implies a high rate of inflation. There are limits. My
                  understanding of recent research is that once inflation starts
                  rising above a certain level-and here economists are still
                  trying to understand whether that level is 5 percent or 10-11
                  percent-it becomes injurious to the prospects for real economic
                  growth. It's injurious to an environment in which business
                  can make decisions that promote growth. And it's injurious
                  to the welfare of the poorest members of society. The question
                  is how to do as much as possible without these macroeconomic
                  constraints starting to bite. We would be negligent if we just
                  ignored these kinds of issues, because we would end up weakening
                  growth and hurting the poor-precisely the people we all want
                  to help.</p>
                <p><b>Q: When did new resources to support HIV/AIDS prevention
                    and treatment appear? </b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: They are just starting to show up. The Global Fund
                  to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has been making commitments
                  for roughly the past three years. But it's taken time for those
                  commitments to be translated into disbursements. That's even
                  more the case for President Bush's HIV/AIDS initiative, which
                  only this year is starting to make disbursements. The amounts
                  of disbursements could mount significantly next year-possibly
                  raising total government spending in the health sectors of
                  some countries by 30 percent to 50 percent to 75 percent, or
                  even much more. </p>
                <p><b>Q: People who are not economists may have trouble understanding
                    why receiving a lot of money could create problems. </b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: When a lot of money for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention
                  pours into a country like Zambia or Malawi, there certainly
                  would be no adverse macroeconomic effects if the funds all
                  went to buy pills. The only question would be, are there sufficient
                  people on the ground to hand out these pills, and make sure
                  that they're handed out to the right people? But if only one-third
                  of the money comes in for pills, and the rest of it comes in
                  to buy the services of nurses, doctors, and community health
                  workers, then the question is, do you have the capacity to
                  expand the supply of skilled professionals in that sector?
                  If the answer is yes, then there should not be a significant
                  problem. But in many of these countries, you don't have that
                  capacity. It may take some time to develop training programs
                  to augment the supply. Until that happens, what could occur
                  is that the government starts bidding for the services of the
                  available people. Other parts of the public sector may demand
                  increased wages as well, arguing that &quot;The nurses are
                  getting higher salaries; why shouldn't we?&quot; And governments
                  may not be able to afford giving higher salaries to everybody.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Do the potential problems go beyond pressure on wages?</b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: Another issue concerns the dedication of substantial
                  external resources to work on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.
                  Does this match the priorities of the government? For example,
                  the new funding may allow the government to do a great job
                  on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, but the government may
                  find itself with few resources for other critical elements
                  of the health sector-for instance, no one to staff health centers
                  for routine maternal-child health visits. Malaria is not going
                  away, tuberculosis is not going away, all the sources of child
                  mortality are not going away. It's not for us in the IMF to
                  judge what the relative priorities should be in the health
                  sector. But we know that governments <i>do</i> worry about
                  a disproportionate focus vis-&agrave;-vis other sectors such
                  as education, agriculture, water supply, and sanitation. Spending
                  in those areas might be powerfully productive in raising economic
                  growth and living standards.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Some of the discussion on HIV/AIDS funding in poor countries
                    brings up the so-called &quot;Dutch Disease.&quot; What does
                    this mean?</b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: The term is used for a currency appreciation arising
                  from an inflow of external resources that adversely affects
                  export incentives and incomes of producers in the export sectors.
                  Let me give you a real-life example: Coffee farmers in Uganda
                  sell to a world market in which prices are quoted in dollars.
                  World coffee prices are slumping. The coffee farmers may be
                  poor to start with-coffee farmers are not rich in Uganda or
                  in many other countries. Uganda receives more foreign aid.
                  And this leads to more demand for non-traded goods-non-imports-including
                  workers' labor. So demand rises for the currency that pays
                  for these goods - the Uganda shilling. The shilling becomes
                  relatively more valuable relative to the dollar. What that
                  means is that the Ugandan selling his coffee for dollars gets
                  fewer shillings for each dollar he makes. Suddenly his income
                  is going down even more. And the international competitiveness
                  of all Ugandan products declines. So &quot;Dutch Disease&quot; refers
                  to a situation where a significant inflow of external resources
                  (whether for oil, remittances, or foreign assistance) leads
                  to an appreciation of the exchange rate that may adversely
                  affect the export sector.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Given that scenario, can aid be a bad thing?</b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: No. On balance, foreign assistance for low-income
                  countries is a good thing, and we recognize that most of the
                  literature indicates that aid facilitates growth. Although
                  the Dutch Disease is a concern to be aware of, we shouldn't
                  make too much of it, at least not at this point. Our perspective
                  in the IMF increasingly is: bring the money on, and if it really
                  starts posing important macroeconomic challenges then we will
                  work with governments to try to address these challenges in
                  a way supportive of growth and poverty reduction. For instance,
                  in middle-income countries, maybe you need to import Sri Lankan
                  or Filipino nurses if you don't have the local nurses on hand.
                  The important thing to emphasize is that if foreign assistance
                  can expand productive capacity, there should not be a significant
                  problem with the Dutch Disease effect over the longer term.
                  Certainly, HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention should be a very
                  supply-inducing kind of intervention. Suddenly people, who
                  hadn't been able to work, can work again. Children, who had
                  had to replace their parents in the fields, can go to school.
                  This is all for the good.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Now that major funding has begun, how long will it continue?</b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: Governments do face the question: can they count
                  on this money for long enough to feel comfortable hiring nurses
                  and doctors? Or do governments lack confidence that this money
                  will come in a year from now? If it doesn't, that could mean
                  a need to release the newly hired nurses and doctors. Given
                  the history of volatility of aid resources, predictability
                  is an enormous concern to countries, especially given the nature
                  of HIV/AIDS treatment. Once you've put someone on antiretrovirals,
                  you're putting them on, hopefully, for the rest of their lives.
                  It's not a situation in which you can put them on and say, &quot;Oops,
                  we don't have them this year; we didn't get the money.&quot; </p>
                <p><b>Q: What can be done to make aid funds flow steadily and
                    predictably?</b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: At least two ideas are being discussed. Gordon Brown
                  [Chancellor of the Exchequer of the U.K. and Chairman of the
                  International Monetary and Financial Committee, the ministerial
                  body that provides twice-yearly guidance to the IMF] has proposed
                  an International Finance Facility, intended to provide the
                  financial resources for a larger and more reliable flow of
                  aid. Jeffrey Sachs [Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia
                  University] has been arguing that more money should be provided
                  to the World Bank through the coming International Development
                  Association replenishment to make possible larger long-term
                  commitments. There has been a tremendous effort by the IMF,
                  among others, to emphasize to donors the need for greater predictability
                  and stability in foreign assistance. The trouble is that parliaments
                  don't pass budgets for 10-year periods. Not surprisingly, donors
                  find it hard to promise assistance for more than a few years.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Has the success in lowering the cost of antiretroviral
                    drugs helped to ease the problems of financing HIV/AIDS work?</b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: Certainly. But we must not lose sight of the fact
                  that pharmaceuticals do not account for all costs. The lowest
                  cost that I have seen for generic antiretrovirals is about
                  $150 a year. But the total cost of treatment is about $450
                  a year, so the labor and systems cost is about $300 a year.
                  That is, the actual drug is only one-third of the cost of having
                  someone on antiretrovirals.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Is the IMF involved in the debate over generic versus
                    brand-name pharmaceuticals? </b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: It's not in our direct mandate, but we would support
                  initiatives for countries to be able to use generic drugs,
                  either that they produce themselves or buy from third-party
                  producers. Because they're cheaper, so a lot more people get
                  treated.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Discussion of financing for HIV/AIDS prevention and
                    treatment in the developing world tends to focus largely
                    on Africa. Should the geographical boundaries be expanded?</b></p>
                <p><b>A</b>: AIDS is a terribly important issue for countries
                  including India and China. In India, even with far lower prevalence
                  rates, the number of people with HIV/AIDS may reach levels,
                  in the next decade, that are as large as any other country
                  in the world. But in terms of new money and resources coming
                  into those countries, it's not going to create potential macroeconomic
                  problems, so it isn't likely to significantly influence the
                  IMF's surveillance discussions with these countries. It would
                  of course concern us as an important underlying structural
                  problem affecting real growth rates, and creating demand for
                  health expenditure. There are a lot of poor people in those
                  countries, there is a big HIV/AIDS problem, and even larger
                  health sector problems. We would certainly approve of more
                  Official Development Assistance being channeled to countries
                  like China and India. </p>

			  <p><b><i><a name="p3a" id="p3a"></a>IEO report: Poverty reduction strategy
			        has fallen short of its potential</i></b></p>
			  <p>The strategy that the IMF and the World Bank have followed for the past
			    five years to help fight poverty in low-income countries has fallen short
			    of its potential, the Fund's <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/NP/ieo/2004/prspprgf/eng/index.htm">Independent
			    Evaluation Office has concluded</a>.</p>
			  <p>That assessment of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) and Poverty
			    Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) grew out of a detailed study based
			    on internal IMF documents, stakeholder surveys and country background
			    studies for Guinea, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Mozambique, Tajikistan, and Tanzania.
			    The World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department joined in some of the
			    research.</p>
			  <p>In launching the PRSP and PRGF in 1999, the IMF and the World Bank aimed
			    to promote country ownership of anti-poverty programs. The papers defining
			    growth-oriented, poverty-fighting strategies would be written by the countries
			    themselves. Lending and debt-relief programs of the IMF and World Bank
			    would grow out of these strategies. The PRGF-under which the IMF makes
			    loans to poverty-plagued nations-was designed to make &quot;pro-poor&quot; growth
			    the centerpiece of IMF-supported programs.</p>
			  <p>The evaluation did find some improvements in lending programs. Anti-poverty
			    spending has increased, although questions remain about how &quot;pro-poor&quot; was
			    some of this spending. Programs show greater fiscal flexibility to accommodate
			    higher aid flows. And the IMF-backed programs require fewer structural
			    conditions. </p>
			  <p>Nevertheless, these improvements do not add up to the envisioned sweeping
			    creation of country-owned strategies, the evaluators said. A major reason
			    for the gap between expectations and results is that incentives focus
			    on producing documents, the evaluation said. Also, benchmarks that measure
			    actual progress are scarce. And little attention is given to differences
			    between countries. Another deficiency is that the PRSP process has not
			    met the goal of fostering debate in poor countries that extends beyond
			    elite circles to the broad populace, including the poor themselves. </p>
			  <p>Recommendations addressed to countries and to the IMF/World Bank for
			    upgrading the PRSP/PRGF process include:</p>
			  <ul>
                <li>The setting of benchmarks in each country; these would be
                  open to public scrutiny.<br>
          <br>
                </li>
                <li> Preparation of clear, candid assessments of progress in
                  each country by IMF and World Bank staff.<br>
          <br>
                </li>
                <li>Development of IMF tasks and priorities tailored to each
                  country's circumstances, as opposed to uniform standards for
                  IMF work in all low-income countries.</li>

			  <p><b><i><a name="p3b" id="p3b"></a>Vatican conference on poverty and globalization</i></b></p>
			  <p>The call to reduce the debt burden of poor countries is being sounded
			    again, as concern mounts that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
			    may be beyond reach of the poorest countries. While greater assistance
			    for many countries is clearly needed, the suggested strategy for fighting
			    poverty faces major practical obstacles, a senior IMF official told a
			    Vatican conference in July.</p>
			  <p>&quot;On the political front, the constraints to funding debt relief
			    have been severe and the generosity of some of the major creditor countries
			    has been limited, not least because of the weak constituencies for foreign
			    assistance in some of the larger countries,&quot; Jack Boorman, consultant
			    and advisor to IMF management, said at a seminar organized by the Pontifical
			    Council for Justice and Peace in Vatican City.</p>
			  <p>The one-day meeting, &quot;Poverty and Globalization: Financing for Development,
			    including the Millennium Development Goals,&quot; took place on July 9.
			    Other participants included Gordon Brown, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer,
			    and chairman of the International Monetary and Financial Committee, along
			    with representatives of the UN and Catholic NGOs, as well as senior members
			    of the church hierarchy. Representatives of Civil Society Organizations
			    from countries in the global South, including Argentina and Zambia, spoke
			    as well.</p>
			  <p>Brown lent a note of urgency to the proceedings, depicting prospects
			    for the MDGs as poor under present conditions. Hope for the Goals, he
			    said, lies in adoption of the proposed International Finance Facility
			    (IFF), which is designed to provide up to $50 billion a year in new development
			    assistance between now and 2015 through the proceeds of bond issues to
			    be repaid by donor countries. Brown also called for greater debt relief
			    for the poorest countries, especially their debt to multilateral organizations.</p>
			  <p>Jean-Pierre Landau, a director of the European Bank for Reconstruction
			    and Development and a former Executive Director of the IMF from France,
			    said that France supports the IFF. But he laid out other ideas tentatively
			    proposed by a French presidential committee assigned to devise ways of
			    creating new aid resources. These include taxes on armaments, on carbon
			    emission, and on international currency transactions. The last is the
			    so-called &quot;Tobin tax,&quot; proposed by Nobel laureate economist
			    James Tobin of Yale University. Supporters of the proposed tax estimate
			    that it could bring in revenues of $100 billion-$300 billion a year. </p>
			  <p>For all of the discussion of ideas to expand the supply of aid funds
			    aimed at the poorest countries, debt relief - including proposed 100 percent
			    write-offs - was the theme most consistently sounded.</p>
			  <p>In his remarks, Boorman said that debt relief should be viewed in the
			    context of all aid channeled to poor countries. Seen in that light, canceling
			    debt is only one way to direct more funds into social service programs
			    in poor countries, and may not be the most effective way. More financing
			    from donor countries and multilateral lenders is clearly needed to increase
			    the total amount of resources available to fight poverty and to help the
			    poorer countries meet or at least approach the MDGs. But access to new
			    lending by donor countries can be jeopardized by debt relief. When donors
			    grant debt relief, they sometimes compensate by making fewer new aid funds
			    available, Boorman said. From donors' perspective, the step is logical,
			    because both debt relief and new financing draw on national budgets. Boorman
			    also urged the wealthier countries to consider raising the amount of aid
			    they give in the form of grants, as opposed to loans, thereby protecting
			    countries from seeing their debt loads reach unsustainable levels.</p>
			  <p>Debt relief may be appropriate in some cases in which debt has already
			    reached unsustainable levels, Boorman acknowledged. But widespread debt
			    cancellation raises two other issues apart from the risk to new lending.
			    One is that some level of obligation may be necessary for the creation
			    or strengthening of a &quot;credit culture,&quot; Boorman argued. The
			    second issue is one of equitable treatment. Some poor countries would
			    not be eligible for debt relief because they have managed their finances
			    and debt obligations prudently. Paradoxically, this would penalize them
			    vis-&agrave;-vis countries that benefit from a debt write-off.</p>

			  <p><b><i><a name="p4a" id="p4a"></a>IMF/World Bank dialogue with World Council
			        of Churches moves ahead</i></b></p>
			  <p>On May 7, IMF and World Bank staff participated in a meeting with representatives
			    of the World Council of Churches (WCC) at its headquarters in Geneva.
			    It was the fourth in a series of meetings that was initiated in 2002 by
			    correspondence between Konrad Raiser, then General Secretary of the WCC,
			    and former IMF Managing Director Horst K&ouml;hler and World Bank President
			    James Wolfensohn. The purposes of the meeting were to review progress
			    in the discussions thus far, and to plan for a possible meeting between
			    the heads of the organizations.</p>
			  <p>The review of discussions<b> </b>(see<a href="021204-2.htm#P85_5557"> Civil
			      Society Newsletter, February 2004</a>) between the Bretton Woods Institutions
			      (BWIs) and the WCC was based partly on two papers distributed at the
			      meeting, one written by WCC representatives, and one prepared by Graham
			      Hacche, Deputy Director of the IMF's External Relations Department,
			      which attempted to clarify areas of agreement and isolate areas of disagreement
			      between the WCC and the BWIs. WCC representatives said that their three
			      main areas of interest for further discussion with the BWIs, including
			      at the planned high-level meeting, are: how to eradicate poverty; justice
			      and human rights; and the &quot;democratization&quot; of the BWIs. The
			      Bank's Katherine Marshall, Director and Counsellor to the President
			      on Values and Ethics, referred to the WCC's apparent underestimation
			      of the importance of the MDGs to the work of the BWIs, and also stated
			      that the Bank's position on human rights was evolving, as were the BWIs'
			      policies on debt reduction and restructuring.</p>
			  <p>With regard to the planned &quot;high-level meeting&quot;, the three
			    parties discussed possible venues, and format. One of the outcomes of
			    such a meeting sought by the WCC would be a public statement of common
			    concerns and objectives. The IMF pointed to the need for more work, whether
			    before or after the high-level meeting, to clarify common ground and divergences
			    of view. As the previous October 2003 meeting in Washington had come to
			    the conclusion that case studies needed to be undertaken to reach greater
			    clarity, participants suggested using the findings of a case study on
			    Honduras, currently being conducted by the German churches, and, at the
			    suggestion of the Bank and Fund representatives, one on Tanzania. </p>
			  <p>Plans for the case studies, a possible subsequent staff meeting to discuss
			    them, and the high-level meeting, will evolve in the coming weeks. </p>

			  <p><b><i><a name="p5a"></a>Managing Director de Rato meets with Vietnamese
			        NGOs</i></b></p>
			  <p><b><i>Susan Adams, Senior Resident Representative, Vietnam</i></b></p>
			  <p>During his visit to Hanoi on June 26, 2004, Managing Director Rodrigo
			    de Rato requested a special meeting with local and international NGOs
			    in Vietnam. He met later that day with representatives from five NGOs
			    (two local and three international). He briefed them on the relations
			    between Vietnam and the IMF; and asked about the particular challenges
			    faced by civil society in Vietnam, and how the IMF could strengthen its
			    partnership with civil society in the country.</p>
			  <p>The NGO representatives covered a variety of issues, including: the growing
			    problem of HIV/AIDS; the rollout of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
			    of Vietnam to the local/grassroots level; the challenges of developing
			    local human resource capacity; and the linkages between monetary policy
			    and microfinancing.</p>
			  <p>The Managing Director noted especially the NGOs' concern about the spread
			    of HIV/AIDS and the authorities' cautious response, particularly on the
			    importation of low-cost antiretroviral drugs. The NGOs attributed
			    this cautious stance to concerns that the importation of such medicines
			    at this time might jeopardize Vietnam's negotiations to join the World
			    Trade Organization (WTO). In that regard, de Rato pointed out that new
			    WTO rules now provided legal options for poor countries to import low-cost
			    medicines from third countries to deal with public health problems such
			    as HIV/AIDS. If those rules were not clear, however, they should be clarified,
			    and the Fund should be an advocate for poor countries in that regard.
			    Later in the week, the IMF Hanoi Office followed up on this discussion
			    by attending a conference on the trade and legal aspects of the HIV/AIDS
			    problem in Vietnam.</p>
			  <p>Vietnam was de Rato's last stop on a week-long tour to Asia in late June,
			    which took him also to Japan, China, and Singapore. This was also his
			    first official travel as Managing Director of the IMF.</p>

			  <p><b><i>David Yuravlivker, Resident Representative, Ecuador</i></b></p>
			  <p>In April, I participated in a meeting sponsored by UNDP to evaluate past
			    dialogue between the government and civil society in Ecuador. The motivation
			    was the government's plan to launch a new round of consultations with
			    civil society on a poverty reduction strategy. There were about 35 attending,
			    including indigenous movements, women's groups, academics, journalists,
			    former high government officials, and local government representatives.
			    Among the lessons drawn were the following: </p>
			  <ul>
                <li><i>There is no single methodology that fits all types of
                    dialogue</i>.<i> </i>A lot of thought and preparation are
                    needed to bring about a fruitful dialogue.<i> <br>
            <br>
          </i></li>
                <li><i>To achieve results, it helps to focus on a small number
                    of well-defined issues and to enlist the support of well-chosen
                    facilitators. </i>In 1998, some 25-30 leaders from various
                    sectors and political groups met in closed, intensive periodic
                    retreats to discuss solutions to the Ecuador-Peru conflict
                    (the Cousin dialogue). Two former presidents from the region
                    were the facilitators. The meeting reached a consensus to
                    support the peace process, which led to the 1998 peace agreement,
                    signed by presidents Mahuad and Fujimori. <br>
          <br>
                </li>
                <li><i>Developing a culture of dialogue builds social capital
                    and has value in and of itself. </i>The national dialogue
                    organized by the indigenous movement in 2003, at the start
                    of the current administration, contributed to developing
                    a culture of seeking consensus through dialogue. However,
                    for proposals to materialize there is often a need to overcome
                    limitations in the operations of public sector systems and
                    to ensure continuous commitment from the highest levels of
                    government.</li>

			  <p><b><i><a name="p5c"></a>A field trip to Haute Guin&eacute;e</i></b></p>
			  <p><b><i>Dennis Jones, Resident Representative, Guinea</i></b></p>
			  <p>My field trip to Haute Guin&eacute;e with AFRICARE gave me first-hand
			    insight into the development needs of some of the isolated parts of Guinea.
			    For a visitor, first there is the problem of access. The trip takes nine
			    hours by road from Conakry (the last 100 km on wholly unpaved roads),
			    and villages have no true road access. The rains did not cause us too
			    many problems going, but on the return trip, the heavens opened, and three
			    hours were added to the journey. Second, communication by other means
			    is virtually nonexistent-there has been no phone service since 2002. And
			    many conveniences that we take for granted, such as electricity and water,
			    can also be absent or difficult to obtain outside the main town. </p>
			  <p>We found many other problems that affect the lives of people in such
			    remote areas. In that context, it was good to see a number of projects
			    bearing results in terms of agricultural production (new crops, new techniques,
			    longer and more stable production cycles); grain storage, food transformation
			    (soy milk, dried vegetables, oils and creams from nuts); nutrition (nutrition
			    plans, well digging and maintenance, and water treatment); health education
			    (for mothers and infants mainly, but also wider education on sexually
			    transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS awareness); and literacy programs. Many
			    of the projects focus on empowering local groups, with the aid of field
			    coordinators, which often results in strong women's groups that are motivated
			    and appear to moving toward self-sustainability. As income-generating
			    activities develop, greater awareness and use of financial systems become
			    evident, mainly through established micro-finance institutions such as
			    Cr&eacute;dit Rural. These groups seem to be working well, with the local
			    authorities giving visible support, and also assistance from other agencies.</p>
			  <p>The three villages we visited were of significantly different sizes (one
			    about 100 inhabitants, another of some 800, and the last about 2000),
			    and had had AFRICARE involvement for different periods, which has allowed
			    some assessment of how the projects and the communities can develop. The
			    range of problems to be tackled has moved from mainly questions of availability
			    of basic resources toward matters of internal administration and how to
			    take charge when AFRICARE's direct involvement phases out. This indicates
			    that progress is being made, but highlights the importance of ensuring
			    that clear systems of accountability and for measuring continuing progress
			    (e.g. financial record keeping and health indicators) are put in place.</p>

			  <ul>
                <li>On May 12, the <b>Nicaragua</b> mission team, headed by mission
                  chief Philip Young, met with Nicaraguan and British NGOs at
                  IMF headquarters in Washington to discuss the country's economic
                  progress on issues such as external debt, taxation, and the
                  budget.<br>
        <br>
                </li>
                <li>On June 3, <b>Global Witness</b>, a U.K.-based NGO that works
                  on the issue of extractive industries transparency, met with
                  Menachem Katz, Assistant Director of the IMF's African Department,
                  Bill Allan and G&uuml;nther Taube, Section Chief and Senior
                  Economist respectively, Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), and
                  Anton Op de Beke, Senior Economist in the Policy Development
                  and Review Department (PDR). They also attended a meeting with
                  IMF staff and other Washington-based NGOs. Global Witness asked
                  IMF staff to adopt best practice by individual country teams
                  and Fund departments into the Fund's overall policy and to
                  make revenue transparency a condition of all IMF lending and
                  technical assistance programs. <br>
        <br>
                </li>
                <li>Klaus Enders, Assistant Director of the IMF Offices in Europe,
                  participated in a panel discussion on &quot;Does the HIPC Initiative
                  Reach the Poor?&quot; at the bi-annual <b>Katholikentag</b>,
                  the German Catholics' Conference, June 17-18 in Ulm, Germany.
                  Other panelists included representatives from NGOs, faith-based
                  organizations, and the German Development Ministry.<br>
      <br>
                </li>
                <li>On June 21, Peter Heller, FAD's Deputy Director, met with
                  U.K.-based NGOs in London to discuss general issues associated
                  with the Fund's role in low-income countries and more specifically
                  on <b>aid absorption for HIV/AIDS</b>. He also met separately
                  three members of a Parliamentary committee working to strengthen
                  the U.K.'s response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.<br>
        <br>
                </li>
                <li>On July 22-23, Jean-Pierre Chauffour, IMF Representative
                  to the WTO, who also liaises with the Geneva-based UN agencies,
                  attended the <b>UN-Social Forum on Human Rights and Poverty</b>,
                  an initiative of the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and
                  Protection of Human Rights. This second round of the Social
                  Forum focused on the contribution of human rights approaches
                  to the fight against poverty at the national and international
                  levels. It was organized around four panels, of which two were
                  of more direct relevance to the Fund: (1) poverty and human
                  rights: empowerment of people living in poverty; and (2) the
                  role of human rights in the development of operational strategies
                  to address poverty. The proposed rights-based approach, as
                  some participants highlighted, resonates with many features
                  of existing poverty reduction strategies (PRSs) supported by
                  the Bretton Woods Institutions.</li>

                    Annual Meetings</a> of the World Bank and the International
                    Monetary Fund and related meetings and events will be held
                    in Washington, D.C. on October 2-3, 2004. As always, a number
                    of policy dialogue sessions for interested CSO representatives
                    will be organized before and during the Meetings. CSO representatives,
                    like all other visitors, must apply for accreditation in
                    order to gain access to the Annual Meetings venues and related
                    events. For the 2004 Annual Meetings CSOs can request accreditation
                    through a new <b>web-based accreditation system</b> at: https://www.imf.org/external/am/2004/csoreg/reg.asp.
                    The system was launched on July 1 and applications for accreditation
                    from interested CSOs will be accepted through September 3.
                    If you are interested in participating in the Annual Meetings,
                    please apply for accreditation as soon as possible, and immediately
                    proceed to obtain a visa to enter the U.S., if necessary.

                <li><a name="P217_35747"></a>The Fund formally set up a dedicated <b>PSIA
                    group</b> in July, 2004 (see <a href="051704.htm#P5a">Civil
                    Society Newsletter May 2004</a>). This initiative is the
                    most recent example of the Fund's recognition of the need
                    for a more systematic approach to integrating poverty and
                    the social impact of policies into the design of PRGF-supported
                    programs. The group is situated at the Fiscal Affairs Department
                    of the Fund, within the Expenditure Policy Division, and
                    will be made up of four experts. Two experts joined as of
                    July 1. David Coady, who previously worked at the International
                    Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in Washington, has
                    extensive experience in the analysis of tax reform, social
                    expenditures, and program evaluation. Prior to joining IFPRI,
                    Coady was an academic at both University and Queen Mary Colleges
                    in London. Moataz El-Said, who also worked previously at
                    IFPRI, has extensive experience in the application of quantitative
                    techniques to policy issues such as trade and price liberalization
                    and their implications for poverty reduction efforts. The
                    remaining staff is expected to join in the coming months.<br>

                  Director of the <b>Independent Evaluation Office</b> (IEO)
                  since it was set up in 2001, resigned in June to become Deputy
                  Chairman of India's Planning Commission (the Chairman being
                  the Prime Minister). IMF Management and the Executive Board
                  congratulated him on his appointment and expressed their appreciation
                  for his work at the IEO. Ahluwalia also received much feedback
                  from CSOs who said they were saddened by the news of his departure
                  and expressed their respect for the integrity and professionalism
                  he brought to the IEO. David Goldsbrough, the IEO's Deputy
                  Director, will serve as Acting Director until a successor is
