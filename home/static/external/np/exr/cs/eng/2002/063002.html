<h3><i><a name="1"></a>The food crisis in Southern Africa </i> </h3>
<p>The food shortages in southern Africa represent a human tragedy that
calls for a committed response from the international community. One country
that has already paid a heavy price is Malawi, and urgent action is still
needed to prevent more starvation. The authorities are working together
with the international donor community to flesh out an appropriate response
and the IMF is fully supportive of these concerted efforts.</p>
<p>In the midst of this tragedy, Malawi has found itself at the center of
a controversy because of the government's sale of almost all of the country's
food reserves last year. As the issue has gained attention, several allegations
have been directed at the IMF: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Fund ordered, forced or advised Malawi to sell off its reserves;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The sales were required so that Malawi could pay off its foreign debt,
or the debt of an agency that controls the food reserves; and<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>the IMF demanded that Malawi reduce spending on poverty-reduction
efforts in order to buy food.</li>
</ul>
<p>These allegations are simply wrong. </p>
<p>The roots of the food crisis in Malawi are very complex. The causes range
from the failure of the government's early warning systems for crop shortfalls;
to over-reliance on maize production; to cutbacks in farmers' plantings
and harvests as government interventions pushed down the maize price;
to transportation bottlenecks in Mozambique that have slowed the flow
of food to Malawi's hungry; to uncooperative weather.</p>
<p>The food crisis should be seen in the context of the government's food
security policy launched in 2000, which was based on a government-commissioned
study funded by the European Commission. The policy had four main pillars:
a) an early warning system to ensure timely warning of any looming shortages;
b) a physical buffer stock of between 30,000 and 60,000 metric tons of
maize for short-term emergencies; c) sufficient foreign exchange reserves
at the central bank to ensure funding to purchase grain in the event of
a larger shortfall; and d) social safety net programs to meet the food
needs of the poor.</p>
<p>In particular, the recommendation related to the buffer stock implied
a substantial reduction of the end-1999 stock of 167,000 metric tons.
The study argued that such large reserves were likely to go to waste because
the maize lasts only a few years in storage and is also very costly to
maintain (absorbing funds equivalent to one-fifth of Malawi's annual spending
on health programs). This was a particularly critical consideration for
the government because a large stock would draw limited resources from
other programs, including the areas that are crucial to poverty reduction
programs such as health, education, and agricultural extension</p>
<p><i>What was the IMF involvement?</i></p>
<p>In December 2000, the IMF Executive Board approved a three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement and a decision point
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, and endorsed Malawi's interim poverty
reduction strategy paper. The main objective of the program with the IMF
was to achieve sustainably higher economic growth to make a sizable reduction
in poverty. All IMF advice has been guided by that objective.</p>
<p><i>The IMF had no role whatsoever in the government-commissioned study
of food security.</i></p>
<p>In Malawi's program with the IMF, the government publicly expressed&#8212;in
its Letter of Intent of December 2000 (<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/loi/2000/mwi/01/index.htm">Section
F in the document</a>) its intention to follow the buffer stock element
of the food security strategy, which meant keeping up to 60,000 tons in
reserve.</p>
<p><i>The IMF did not at any time insist that Malawi reduce its food stocks
as a condition of Fund lending.</i> During 2001, the government decided
to sell off almost all of its maize reserves, leaving far less than the
targeted level of reserves, apparently because the government assumed
that it could replenish its stores from the approaching harvest. However,
crop estimates were wrong, and crop production turned out to be much lower
than expected. The early warning systems failed to alert the authorities
or the international community to the looming shortages. The sales have
been followed by media allegations of corruption.</p>
<p><i>The Fund had no role in the government's decision to sell off far
more than the amount recommended in the EC-funded study and in the Letter
of Intent. </i>At no time did the IMF &quot;pressure&quot; Malawi in any
fashion, or advise Malawi, to sell its grain reserve to pay its debts.
The December 2000 Letter of Intent does not mention debt in the context
of grain sales, and Fund officials have not drawn that link during meetings
with Malawian officials at any level.</p>
<p><i>At no time has the IMF demanded that Malawi pay for food imports by
cutting spending of any sort.</i> </p>
<p>The IMF has publicly stated that any emergency funds needed to alleviate
the impending food crisis should be made available through the budget
without any offsetting cuts. In any case, required food imports are likely
to be paid for by donors and not by the Malawi government. </p>
<p>The government continues to support extensive social safety net programs,
including subsidies targeted at the poor that cover food and some health,
education and agricultural-input programs. The IMF supports this policy.</p>
<p>Malawi's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) loan from the IMF
was suspended during 2001 because of the government's inability to bring
under control wasteful spending&#8212;especially on state-owned companies&#8212;that
was causing interest rates to rise to high levels and taking resources
away from the poor. The IMF's portion of the debt relief program was also
suspended. However, the government now is working closely with the Fund
to bring that spending under control, and it is hoped that the PRGF and
debt relief will be restored soon.</p>
<p><i>What needs to be done?</i></p>
<p>A quick and coordinated response by the government and the donor community
is now needed to ensure that Malawi's population will not suffer further
later this year. First and foremost, the estimate of the food deficit
during the 2002/03 growing season will have to be firmed up quickly to
ensure that sufficient food will arrive on time; it is expected that estimates
from a WFP/FAO mission and a household survey financed by CIDA will become
available soon. Government interventions in the past may have contributed
to the current crisis by eroding incentives for producing food. Therefore,
appropriate delivery mechanisms are critical so as not to depress food
production in the coming years. Food imports are likely to be financed
by donors, and the IMF has indicated publicly that any emergency funds
needed for food imports should be covered by the budget without any offsetting
cuts. </p>
<p>The government has acknowledged the failure of the food security strategy
and has publicly announced that it will embark on a comprehensive review
to avert another food shortage in the future.</p>
<p>The IMF has met with NGOs, both in Washington and in Malawi, to clarify
its position and to discuss its advice to the Malawian authorities. It
will continue to engage with civil society on how best to serve the interests
of the people of Malawi.</p>

<h3><i><a name="2"></a>IMF establishes African Regional Technical Assistance
Centers</i></h3>
<p>On his <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/nb/2002/nb0237.htm">third
visit to Africa</a> since becoming IMF Managing Director, Horst K&ouml;hler
signed agreements to establish two African Regional Technical Assistance
Centers (AFRITAC). The Center <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/nb/2002/nb0242.htm">Abidjan</a>
will serve West African countries, while the Center in <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/nb/2002/nb0239.htm">Dar
es Salaam</a> will meet the training needs in East Africa. </p>
<p>Both centers are expected to become operational later in the year and,
if the concept proves successful, three more centers will be established
to cover the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. Through the centers, modeled
on the IMF's regional technical assistance centers in the Pacific and
the Caribbean, the IMF will provide assistance with a team of resident
experts, supplemented by short-term specialists, as well as through in-country
workshops, professional training, and regional courses.</p>
<p>The Centers are part of the IMF <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2002/pr0224.htm">Africa
Capacity Building Initiative</a>, whose goal is to strengthen the capacity
of African countries to design and implement their poverty-reducing strategies,
as well as to improve the coordination of capacity building technical
assistance in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process. It
aims to increase the volume of capacity building assistance from the IMF
to Africa in the IMF's core areas of expertise. The centers are also a
contribution by the IMF to the New Partnership for Africa's Development
(NEPAD). </p>
<h3><i><a name="3"></a>The HIPC Initiative&#8212;Status of implementation</i></h3>
<p>In a joint report released in April, the IMF and the World Bank laid
out the accomplishments of and the challenges facing the HIPC Initiative.
The report, <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/hipc/2002/status/041202.htm">Status
of Implementation</a>, is prepared every six months for discussion during
the institutions' Spring and Annual Meetings. Since September, four countries&#8212;Mozambique,
Tanzania, Burkina Faso and Mauritania have reached their completion points,
while three&#8212;Ethiopia, Ghana and Sierra Leone - have reached the
decision points. </p>
<p>But the report warned that &quot;fewer countries than expected reached
their completion points&quot; because countries have required more time
than anticipated to develop poverty reduction strategies and some countries
have experienced delays in implementing key macroeconomic or structural
reform policies. </p>
<p>The document also said that the deterioration of the global economic
environment - especially slower economic growth and weaker commodity prices
- has made it more difficult for countries to achieve and maintain debt
sustainability, with &quot;virtually all HIPCs being heavily dependent
on primary commodities for their exports.&quot; While emphasizing the
need for all HIPCs to pursue prudent debt management policies as a means
of achieving long-term debt sustainability, the report also stressed that
the Initiative provides for the possibility of additional debt relief
at the completion point in exceptional cases where external factors have
caused fundamental changes in a country's economic circumstances. Burkina
Faso was the first country to be provided with such additional debt relief
(see separate story).</p>
<p><b><i>Countries off-track</i></b></p>
<p>The paper notes that in a few countries (Guyana, The Gambia, Guinea,
Nicaragua, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, Zambia) were off-track with their Fund-Bank
supported programs. As of mid-June, the status of these countries was
as follows:</p>
<p><b><i>Guyana</i></b></p>
<p>Authorities are making progress towards putting in place a new three-year
PRGF-supported economic program covering 2002-05 that is consistent with
their PRSP. A satisfactory track record of performance under the new PRGF
program is one of the conditions for reaching the HIPC completion point.
Progress in fulfilling most of the other floating completion point conditions
is expected over the next few months. Assuming all the pending conditions
are met, the completion point could be reached by end 2002.</p>
<p><b><i>The Gambia</i></b></p>
<p>With regard to The Gambia, the program was not off track as such: the
main problems were the delayed preparation of the PRSP and other outstanding
issues that delayed conclusion of the negotiations. The April/May 2002
mission reached understandings with the authorities on a new three-year
PRGF arrangement. The PRSP was sent to the Bank and Fund in May 2002.
We now expect to go to the Board on July 10, with the request for the
PRGF, supported by the full PRSP and a joint staff assessment (JSA) of
the latter.</p>
<p>The Gambia has been receiving interim debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative since 2001 and has requested the Fund to continue providing
such relief in 2002. Debt relief is provided through arrangements that
permit a country to keep part of the debt payment due to creditors and
use it for poverty-reducing expenditure.</p>
<p><b><i>Guinea-Bissau</i></b></p>
<p>The PRGF-supported arrangement for Guinea-Bissau, approved by the IMF's
Executive Board on December 15, 2000, went off track at end-2000 as a
result of large unauthorized expenditures and a breakdown in financial
controls. The reestablishment of sustainable government finances has remained
an elusive goal.</p>
<p>During 2001, the IMF, along with the World Bank, the EU and bilateral
supporters, provided technical assistance in order to strengthen financial
discipline and ensure that resources are used according to priorities.
The Fund staff worked with the authorities to establish a short-term macroeconomic
program for the second half of 2002, in order to help Guinea-Bissau move
back towards a sustainable financial position. The short-term program
introduced a treasury cash-flow plan, measures to regain control of budget
implementation, strengthen tax and customs administration and avoid the
further accumulation of domestic arrears.</p>
<p>The Guinean authorities have not found it easy to restore government
finances to a sustainable position. In March 2002, the Fund staff visited
Bissau to discuss economic and financial policies with the authorities
and reviewed steps that could be taken to address continuing problems.
As of mid-June 2002, however, the National Assembly was still debating
the budget for 2002.</p>
<p><b><i>Honduras</i></b></p>
<p>The PRGF program went off track in 2001 as large fiscal slippages occurred
during the transition to the new administration that took office in late
January 2002. Negotiations on a PRGF program for 2002 have not been completed
because of a projected deterioration in the fiscal stance for 2002-03.
The authorities need to strengthen the fiscal policy stance through actions
designed to revamp tax collections, reverse an upward trend in the government's
wage bill relative to GDP starting this year, and establish a sustainable
wage policy framework. The authorities have agreed to work out a revised
fiscal strategy with a view of resuming discussions on the PRGF program
possibly by July.</p>
<p><b><i>Malawi</i></b></p>
<p>The PRGF program went off track shortly after approval in December 2000.
Due to fiscal slippages, in particular overspending on nonpriority items,
the review could not be completed. Thus, the IMF has not credited the
HIPC Trust Fund account for 2002. However, all other creditors&#8212;accounting
for well over 90 percent of the total relief&#8212;continue to provide interim
debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. The IMF interim debt relief will
be made available upon completion of the first review and no money will
be lost for Malawi.</p>
<p>Under the PRGF arrangement, agreement on the way forward has been reached
in March 2002. Malawi has started to contain expenditure and a decisive
fiscal adjustment will be implemented with the 2002/03 budget. After successfully
establishing a track record of policy performance through September, the
staff expects to recommend to the Executive Board before year-end completion
of the first review. The authorities, the staff, and the international
community are currently working on a concerted response to the impending
food shortages expected for later this year</p>
<p><b><i>Nicaragua</i></b></p>
<p>After reaching the HIPC decision point in December 2000, Nicaragua's
PRGF arrangement went off track. However, a mission initiated discussions
on a new three-year PRGF arrangement in March 2002 and reached a preliminary
agreement on the main elements of the first year program, which would
cover July 2002-June 2003. Actions agreed to be taken include the approval
of a modification to the 2002 budget, a tax reform aimed at improving
the efficiency and equity of the tax system, and a recovery plan for assets
acquired from intervened banks. The authorities have begun to prepare
a progress report on their PRSP, which was originally presented to the
Boards of the Fund and the Bank in September 2001. </p>
<p>Discussions are expected to continue in the weeks ahead and the new program
is expected to be presented to the IMF Board during the third quarter
of 2002. Nicaragua has begun to receive interim HIPC assistance form the
World Bank, IDB and CABEI. Following the approval of a program with the
IMF, it would be expected to receive interim assistance from the Fund
and Paris Club members.</p>
<p><b><i>Zambia</i></b></p>
<p>On May 29, the IMF completed the fourth review of <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/nb/2002/nb0245.htm">Zambia's
performance under an economic program supported by the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility</a> (PRGF), and agreed to increase the amount of potential
access to IMF resources over the remainder of the program. As a result,
Zambia will be able to draw up to US$64 million from the facility immediately,
and have potential access to US$159.8 million in the course of subsequent
program reviews scheduled into February 2003, an increase of about US$31
million. </p>
<p>The IMF also approved the release of US$150.7 million in 2002 as additional
interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. This assistance
represents nearly 70 percent of Zambia's principal obligations to the
IMF in 2002, and brings total assistance by the IMF under the Initiative
to about US$301.5 million. </p>
<p><b><i>Other HIPC news:</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Burkina Faso to receive additional debt relief</i></b></p>
<p>The IMF and the World Bank agreed last April to award <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2002/pr0221.htm">additional
debt relief to Burkina Faso </a>under the HIPC Initiative in light of
external factors that negatively affected the country's exports. </p>
<p>The Boards of the IMF and Bank agreed that Burkina Faso would require
exceptional debt relief, or &quot;topping-up&quot;, to achieve debt sustainability,
and endorsed an additional US$129 million in net present value terms of
debt relief. </p>
<p>The Bank and the Fund said that the external factors included falling
world cotton prices&#8212;resulting in part from heavy subsidies in industrialized
country markets&#8212;political and economic events in neighboring countries,
and crop damage due to agricultural parasites. </p>
<p>With this additional treatment, the total nominal debt service relief
provided under the HIPC Initiative is about US$930 million.</p>
<p><b><i>Mauritania becomes sixth country to reach completion point</i></b></p>
<p>On June 19, the IMF and the World Bank announced that <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2002/pr0229.htm">Mauritania
had reached its completion point </a> under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.<sup>
</sup>Mauritania thus became the sixth country to reach this point, joining
Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda.<br>
<br>
Debt service relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative from all of Mauritania's
creditors will amount to approximately US$1.1 billion over time (US$622
million in net present value [NPV] terms).As a result of HIPC assistance,
the net present value of Mauritania's total external debt is reduced by
some 50 percent, providing a good basis for long-term debt sustainability.
This, however, will require continued efforts to monitor the debt level
and to apply prudent debt management policies, the IMF and the Bank said
in a statement.</p>

<h3><i><a name="4"></a>Africa needs better trade opportunities to fight
poverty&#8212;K&ouml;hler </i></h3>
<p>During his visit to Africa, IMF Managing Director Horst K&ouml;hler repeated
a message that rich countries have heard from him often in recent months:
open your markets to the products of Africa and other developing nations.
In particular, he emphasized the need to increase access to developing
countries' agricultural exports, including through reduction in industrial
country subsidies. </p>
<p>&quot;It is no longer possible to sustain the agricultural policy in
the advanced countries, which de facto means closed markets and $300 billion
of trade-distorting policies,&quot; Mr. K&ouml;hler told a news briefing
upon a day of meetings in his first stop, Dar es Salaam. &quot;If this
is not going to change, all our efforts against poverty will remain not
satisfactory,&quot; he added. </p>
<p>In Ouagadougou, K&ouml;hler told cotton producers and business leaders: &quot;I know that the United States alone is spending $2 billion (annually) for its cotton subsidies, more than the total production of sub-Saharan Africa of cotton and the same goes for sugar in the European Union&#8212;they are spending more than &#8364;2 billion in Europe for sugar subsidies. I think this is something perverse and we need to change it. If we are not able to give you better trade opportunities then maybe the fight against poverty is lost from the beginning.&quot; </p>
<p>K&ouml;hler said developed countries should also cut tariffs on finished
goods such as clothing, or processed foods like chocolate. Only then,
he said, could poor countries really improve their own economies and become
less dependent on outside help. </p>
<p>In Ghana, K&ouml;hler said in a speech that the recently passed U.S.
farm bill, which increases domestic subsidies for the agricultural sector,
was a setback to the battle against poverty. </p>
<p>The message was also delivered to the OECD agricultural ministers meeting
in Paris in mid-May. <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/cm/2002/051602.htm">In
a joint statement with the heads of the WTO and the World Bank, K&ouml;hler
asked</a> how leaders &quot;in developing countries or in any capital
could argue for more open economies if leadership in this area is not
forthcoming from wealthy nations.&quot;</p>
<p>K&ouml;hler, Moore and Wolfensohn said that &quot;any increase in protectionism
by any country is damaging. Such actions will hurt growth prospects where
fostering growth is most essential. And they are sending the wrong signal,
threatening to undermine the ability of governments everywhere to build
support for market-oriented reforms ... Prospects for reform of agricultural
support policies and textiles regimes, toward interventions that are less
damaging to the economic opportunities of the poor, are particularly important.&quot;
</p>
<p>But the developing countries can also do much to help themselves. The
heads of the international financial institutions also added that &quot;south-south
trade in the 1990s grew faster than world trade and now accounts for more
than a third of developing country exports. Yet the barriers to this trade
are higher still than to trade with industrial countries. Most of the
benefits of liberalization derive from action at home. Sound trade policies
are rarely contingent on the policies of others.&quot;</p>
<h3><i><a name="5"></a>Uganda: health spending, aid flows, and the IMF advice
</i></h3>
<p>The recent public debate on aid flows to Uganda has focused on speculation
about the advice offered by the IMF to the government. In an open letter
to the authorities, Professor Jeffery Sachs wrote that he had heard, but
had not verified, that the Fund warned against accepting new donor grants
for health expenditures, supposedly arguing that to do so would lead to
an undue appreciation of the currency. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/vc/2002/060702.htm">In a letter
to Eurodad's PRS-Watch</a> dated June 7, the IMF denied this rumor, stating
that it is not true that Uganda may have to refuse aid for health or any
other poverty-eradication programs in order to adhere to IMF-imposed guidelines.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's priority&#8212;a priority that is shared by the IMF&#8212;is
to increase the availability of domestic and foreign resources to reduce
poverty. Indeed, IMF staff have suggested restructuring public spending
so as to accommodate higher expenditures for important social and economic
sectors,&quot; External Relations Department Director Thomas Dawson said.
</p>
<p>&quot;In the specific case of Uganda, given that the aid flows in question
are to be used for top priority spending such as imports of life-saving
drugs and other essential medical supplies, we do not see any adverse
effects on the macro economy. Moreover, even if these aid flows placed
pressure on the exchange rate and the competitiveness of the economy,
these effects could be minimized through monetary and exchange rate policies.&quot;
</p>
<p>In a meeting with NGOs in Washington on June 18, IMF mission chief Godfrey
Kalinga again stated that the amounts of aid and increases in health spending
currently under discussion in Uganda would have minimal macroeconomic
impact. He said there is a level at which the management of aid flows,
and their impact on the economy, needs to be monitored, and the current
mission to the country is working very hard at trying to fixing that limit
with the government. The impact of the flows would depend. Among other
things, on the size of the flows, the import composition of the use of
these flows, and whether these flows are spent effectively and productively.
</p>
<p>The broad discussion on these issues, which is closely linked to the
issue of fiscal flexibility in PRGF-supported programs, will undoubtedly
continue, and the Fund will continue to meet and discuss its policy with
civil society representatives. </p>
<h3><i><a name="6"></a>Krueger outlines new details of IMF's proposal for
a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism</i></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2002/060602.htm">In
a speech in Washington on June 6</a>, IMF First Deputy Managing Director
Ann Krueger detailed the progress made by the IMF on a two-track approach
to improve sovereign debt restructuring. The approach was endorsed by
the International Monetary and Financial Committee at its April Meetings.
</p>
<p>The first track involves more ambitious use of collective action clauses
in sovereign bond contracts. The second - and complementary - track involves
creating a statutory mechanism that can help secure more orderly and timely
restructuring of unsustainable sovereign debts. </p>
<p>Ms. Krueger went on to clarify one important issue that has stirred much
debate since her first speech on the issue last November: the role of
the IMF. Many commentators, while welcoming the discussion around the
need for an orderly and fair process to restructure debts, have strongly
objected to a central role for the IMF in the whole mechanism. </p>
<p>Ms. Krueger said that a treaty obligation - probably achieved through
an Amendment of the IMF's Articles of Agreement (the IMF's &quot;constitution&quot;)
- would empower a super-majority of creditors to reach agreement with
the debtor and bind in the rest. But, she emphasized, the amendment would
be used only as a tool to empower the creditors and debtor, not as a way
to extend the IMF's legal authority. The Fund would only influence the
process as it does now, through its normal lending decisions.</p>
<p>She also outlined what shape a dispute resolution forum could take. </p>
<p>She went on to conclude: &quot;In a world in which sovereign borrowers
have diffuse and diverse creditor bases, we need a way to overcome the
coordination and collective action problems that stand in the way of timely
and efficient restructuring. For both the contractual and statutory approaches,
that means addressing the problems created by the diversity of legal jurisdictions
in which creditors can seek repayment. We believe that a dispute settlement
forum - small in size, limited in role, and demonstrably independent in
its membership and operation - is the best way to achieve this. To help
avoid chaotic defaults or expensive bailouts in the future, that is surely
a price worth paying&quot; </p>
<p>IMF staff have met with NGOs on several occasions to discuss Ms. Krueger's
proposal. Public debates were organized in New York and Monterrey, Mexico,
in the context of the Financing for Development Conference, while in Washington
DC meetings took place at the time of the Spring Meetings and on May 13.
The discussion focused mainly on the role of the Fund and on the so-called
Chapter 9 proposition&#8212;the chapter in the U.S. bankruptcy code that applies
to governmental organizations like municipalities and that seeks to protect
the rights of taxpayers and employees to participate in the insolvency
process.</p>

New Approach to Sovereign Debt Restructuring</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2002/pr0222.htm">Communiqu&eacute;
of the International Monetary and Financial Committee, April 20, 2002</a>

<h3><i><a name="7"></a>IMF co-sponsors CIS-7 Initiative</i></h3>
<p>The IMF is co-sponsoring <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2002/pr0223.htm">an
international initiative</a> aimed at reducing poverty, promoting economic
growth, and reducing debt to sustainable levels in seven countries of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Other sponsors include the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development. Assistance under the CIS-7 initiative will be provided
through loans, grants, debt restructuring, and debt relief. Support will
be conditional on the seven countries adopting sound economic policies.
</p>
<p>The CIS-7 Initiative was prompted by the realization that the challenges
posed by transition in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic,
Moldova, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan have been underestimated. Also, while
the CIS-7 countries have made good progress toward establishing democracies
and market economies, reforms have not always been effectively implemented.
As a result, living standards have declined sharply in all seven countries,
with nearly 20 million people now living in extreme poverty. </p>
<p>In recognition of this situation, representatives of the CIS-7 governments,
creditor countries, and four international financial institutions agreed,
at a seminar in London in February 2002, to make new efforts to increase
economic growth and reduce poverty in the CIS-7 countries. The CIS-7 Initiative
was officially endorsed at a ministerial meeting in Washington, D.C. on
April 20, 2002.</p>
<p>Assistance under the initiative will be provided under existing policies
and frameworks. In particular, </p>
<ul>
<li>the Paris Club countries will consider requests for debt relief as
needed;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>debt relief under the HIPC Initiative might also be a possibility,
although only one or two of the CIS-7 countries presently appear to
qualify, and only for small benefits;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>consultative group meetings will be organized to mobilize donor support;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Aid effectiveness should be enhanced, possibly by making use of the
PRSP framework to ensure greater coordination among donors;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>existing IFI programs with CIS-7 countries should continue, both as
a means for the countries to demonstrate greater ownership of reforms
and to facilitate a greater flow of IFI resources in the future;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>major trading partners should remove barriers to exports from the
CIS-7 countries.</li>
</ul>
<h3><i><a name="8"></a>Field reports: IMF staff interaction with civil society</i></h3>
<p><b><i>Nicaragua&#8212;Dialogue on the new PRGF </i></b></p>
<p>In Nicaragua, the government, National Assembly, civil society, syndicates
and political parties maintain frequent and visible contact with the Fund
office. The press provides an aggressive coverage of the meetings with
the various stakeholders. </p>
<p>Given that the Fund is currently negotiating a new 3-year PRGF with the
new government that took office in January 2002, public interest is high
in all aspects of economic decision-making. The former president of the
Central bank, Dr. No&euml;l Ramirez, who is now president of the Economic
Commission (EC) of the National Assembly, has encouraged a constructive
dialog not only with the Fund office, but also with the opposition parties
and civil society. The EC itself includes deputies with strong links to
the syndicates, civil society and the church. During a meeting at the
end of May, at the request of the government, the IMF Resident Representative,
Joachim Harnack, presented to the EC the status of the negotiations with
the Fund, highlighting the need for tax reform, alignment of expenditures
with available resources, and the systematic recovery of assets of four
banks that had failed during 2000-01.</p>
<p>Mr. Harnack also gave the first in a series of lectures to the National
Council for Economic and Social Planning (CONPES), informing the gathering
of broad aspects of the PRGF negotiations. Composed of some 50 high-level
representatives from civil society, syndicates, and political parties,
the council is actively engaged in the country's poverty alleviation strategy.
The series is financed by the World Bank and draws speakers from various
economic areas, including government institutions.</p>
<p><b><i>Serbia&#8212;Improved dialogue with the trade unions; corruption issues</i></b></p>
<p>The Office of the Resident Representative is committed to improving dialogue
with trade unions through more systematic and regular meetings with trade
unions (so far, several have been held) and by participating in trade
union conferences and meetings </p>
<p>To this end, IMF Resident Representative Joshua Charap participated in
the labor union conference &quot;Trade Union Strategies in the Process
of Transition&quot;, held in Belgrade on 24 January 2002, where he made
a presentation on the impact of IMF programs on social dialogue. </p>
<p>The Resident Representative Office also discussed issues relating to
corruption with Transparency International. A &quot;box&quot; (brief report)
on progress in fighting corruption in Serbia was included in an <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=15849.0">IMF
staff report </a>submitted to the IMF's Executive Board in late April
2002. </p>
<p><b><i>Tajikistan: Economic policy issues and the PRSP</i></b></p>
<p>During an April visit to Dushanbe, Mr. John Odling-Smee, Director of
the European II Department met with representatives of local and international
NGOs, including Save the Children, Aga Khan Foundation, M&eacute;decins
sans Fronti&egrave;res, the National Association of Business Women and
CARE International. On the consultation process used for the preparation
of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the consensus view among
NGOs was that participation in the preparation process was extremely valuable.
For many of them it was the first opportunity to interact with government
officials on policy issues. They also noted that the final version of
the PRSP would be carefully examined to see if their views were fully
reflected. </p>
<p>NGOs urged the Fund to support policies that could strengthen governance,
reduce corruption, and provide resources directly to the NGOs. Mr. Odling-Smee
explained that Fund-supported programs would address governance and corruption,
but were unable to provide direct support to their organizations.</p>
<p>Mr. Odling-Smee noted that future missions would meet with NGO representatives
on a regular basis.</p>
<p><b><i>Turkey&#8212;Dialogue on the economic program</i></b></p>
<p>The missions and the resident Representative office have active contacts
with a range of CSOs, including in some cases regular meetings and participation
in seminars sponsored by these organizations. The key CSO contacts include
the main public sector labor union (TURK-IS), the two business organizations
(TUSIAD, representing large- scale industrialists, and TOBB, representing
SMEs), the bankers' association, the foreign investors' association (YASED),
and the exporters' association (TIM).</p>
<p>A range of issues are important both to these organizations and to the
Fund. These issues include the economic program generally (including the
political support from CSOs), labor market issues (wages and job security),
banking reform, taxation, and the business environment (removing red tape,
fighting corruption, improving the FDI framework).</p>
<p><b><i>Ukraine - How to achieve the Millennium Development Goals</i></b></p>
<p>In Ukraine, the interaction between the Resident Representative office
and civil society organizations has concentrated mainly on the issues
of poverty alleviation, agricultural policy, human development, the impact
of the Chernobyl nuclear accident, the ecological dimensions of sustainable
development and their interaction with economic policy, as well as on
problems of transparency and fairness related to the recent parliamentary
elections. </p>
<p>Specifically, discussion has focused on how the policies of the government,
under the Fund-supported program, could better contribute toward achieving
the Millennium Goals. Inter alia, the priorities thus identified have
led to the recommendations that: (i) the tax system be streamlined, eliminating
a myriad of economically unjustifiable exemptions and privileges for some
economic sectors, thereby broadening the tax base, permitting a reduction
in tax rates, and leading to a more equitable tax burden; and (ii) priority
expenditures in health and education be protected, despite the significant
spending cuts that are necessary in order to preserve macroeconomic stability.
</p>
<p><b><i>At headquarters in Washington</i></b></p>
<p>Some 12 NGO representatives from eight different countries visited the
Fund on June 12 as part of an international program sponsored by the School
for International Training (Vermont, USA). NGO representative visit Washington
and New York for meetings with NGOs, Congress, and international organizations.
At the IMF, they met with several staff members to discuss the Fund role
in poverty reduction, the role of the Independent Evaluation Office, and
the Fund outreach to civil society. They also met with economists who
work on their countries of origin.</p>
<p>A preparatory meeting held on June 19 discussed the details of a high-level
meeting between the IMF, the World Bank and the labor unions (ICFTU, WCL,
AFL-CIO) that will take place in Washington in October.</p>
<p>Since the Spring Meetings in April, IMF staff met with NGOs to discuss
various topics, including the IMF proposal for a sovereign debt restructuring
mechanism; the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/ieo/index.htm">Independent
Evaluation Office</a>'s reports; the PRSP and the status of implementation
of the HIPC Initiative; country-specific issues on Uganda, Malawi, and
The Gambia. </p>
