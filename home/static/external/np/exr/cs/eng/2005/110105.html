<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">Recent Developments in IMF-CSO Relations</a></h2>




<p>At the September  24-25 World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings, the international community took a big  step toward delivering on its promise of a multibillion-dollar debt  cancellation plan for the most heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs). That  was originally proposed at the G-8 finance ministers' meeting in London in June and endorsed at the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland,  in July. Civil society organizations (CSOs)  who had been lobbying for this deal during 2005, welcomed the progress at the  Annual Meetings, but are waiting for more details to become public. </p>
<p>The Governors  attending the Annual Meetings also encouraged the Board to finalize new tools  for IMF cooperation with low-income countries, including a new financing window  and a facility that targets their special needs. An <a href="#LIC">article</a> gives  an overview of these new instruments as well as an update of other developments in the IMF's work on low-income countries. Governors also <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/cm/2005/092405e.htm">endorsed</a> a medium-term  strategy for the Fund that has been <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/2005/eng/091505.pdf">proposed </a> by  Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato. </p>
<p>The Annual Meetings traditionally offer an opportunity for  representatives of CSOs to sit down with staff members from the Bank and the  Fund in meetings organized by both institutions and CSOs. About 180 people from  organizations in 30 countries attended the <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/CSO/0,,contentMDK:20671528~pagePK:220503~piPK:220476~theSitePK:228717,00.html">civil society dialogues</a>, including the third annual <a href="#townhall">Townhall meeting </a> with leaders of the two institutions.</p>


  <h2 align="left"><a name="feature" id="feature">Feature Article:</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="LIC" id="LIC"><em>An  update on the IMF's work on low-income </em></a><em>countries</em></h3>
  <p>For some time,  the IMF has been considering a number of actions it can take to better serve  its low-income members. To this end, the Fund has recently undertaken a  thorough reassessment of its engagement with low-income countries (LICs),  focusing on making its lending and policy advice more responsive to the of needs  LICs, and on better defining how it engages with country authorities, other  multilateral organizations and bilateral donors, civil society organizations,  and other development partners. This review has resulted in the following  proposals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>that the Poverty  Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) should remain the main instrument for  assisting low-income members;</li>
    <li>that a new  window in the PRGF Trust should be created, whose aim would be to help  low-income members facing exogenous shocks; and</li>
    <li>that a new non-financial  mechanism, the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) should be established, with a  view to improving the way in which the Fund supports and signals sound  policies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The IMF also is  reviewing its role in the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process, and has  recently reviewed the design of PRGF-supported programs. Finally, once the next  stage of multilateral debt relief is finalized, that program will provide  additional resources to LICs.</p>
  <p><strong>Reviewing the  Poverty Reduction Strategy framework</strong></p>
  <p>    The IMF is working  closely with other development partners to ensure that the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/prsp.htm">PRS framework </a> provides an effective tool for fostering growth, poverty reduction, and  progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). To these ends, the  Fund plans to review its role in the PRS process and the interaction of this  role with its financial facilities and other forms of interaction with LICs. A  key priority is to embed the PRS process into existing domestic decision-making  processes and systems, including the annual budget, and to align PRSs with  programs supported under the PRGF as well as Fund signaling of its support for  policies and Fund support for debt relief.</p>
  <p>The 2005  IMF/World Bank review of the PRS approach&#8212;&quot;<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2005/091905p.pdf">Balancing Accountability and Scaling Up  Results</a>&quot; &#8212;showed that the PRS approach has helped  put poverty reduction at the center of the public policy debate in LICs. The  elaboration and implementation of PRSPs was associated with improvement in some  socio-economic indicators in LICs, especially in Africa.  Looking ahead, the review found that the PRS approach could and should continue  to be the operational framework for expanding efforts to meet the MDGs, and for  translating mutual accountability of country authorities and development  partners into concrete development plans at the country level.</p>
  <p><strong>The Poverty  Reduction and Growth Facility</strong></p>
  <p>    The <a href="../../../facts/prgf.html">Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility  (PRGF) </a> remains the IMF's main facility for financial  assistance to LICs. Established in September 1999, the PRGF aims to make  poverty reduction and growth the central objective to the Fund's lending  operations in its poorest member countries. PRGF-supported policy programs are  framed around comprehensive, country-owned PRSPs. In order to continue the  provision of effective support for LICs' efforts to improve macroeconomic  stability, achieve sustainable growth, and reduce poverty, the Fund realizes  that it must adapt to the evolving needs of its members. The Fund recently  completed its <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2005/pn05127.htm">review of the design of PRGF-supported  programs </a> among the more economically stable  low-income members, or &quot;mature stabilizers.&quot; It found that while many LICs  still need significant macroeconomic adjustment, many others have achieved  broad macroeconomic stability and sustained growth, often with its support.</p>
  <p>The recent review  confirmed the importance of macroeconomic stability and an open economy for  sustained growth. It highlighted the central roles of private investment and  exports, and also focused attention on the importance of sound institutions. It  also examined how fiscal space could be created for urgent spending needs,  beyond what can be achieved through a better allocation of existing resources.  A key finding concerns the importance of well-designed fiscal and monetary  policies in managing higher inflows of foreign aid. As regards to monetary  policy, the study found support for targeting single-digit inflation rates, and,  if monetary targets are used, for them to allow for financial deepening. </p>
  <p><strong>Protecting against  exogenous shocks</strong></p>
  <p>    The IMF's  Executive Board has agreed in principle to the creation of a new financing  window within the PRGF Trust for low-income members hit by exogenous shocks.  This window will provide financial support at PRGF terms to low-income members  without a PRGF arrangement. It will also serve as a potential safety net for  countries that wish to exit from continuous PRGF program engagement. This window  complements <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/howlend.htm">existing facilities </a> available to assist LICs facing shocks, such as augmentations of PRGF access;  the Compensatory Financing Facility; subsidized emergency assistance for  natural disasters and post conflict cases; the use of credit tranche resources;  and the Trade Integration Mechanism for balance of payments shortfalls arising from  multilateral trade liberalization.</p>
  <p><strong>Policy support  and signaling</strong></p>
  <p>    The Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which was  established in October and which will soon be operational, is aimed at  providing signaling of IMF support for policy programs without financing in LICs.  The PSI will be an important addition to the range of facilities from which  LICs can choose their desired form of engagement with the IMF.</p>
  <p>The facility would be available to  PRGF-eligible members that desire IMF endorsement of their policies, but that  do not want or need the IMF's financial assistance. These would also be  countries that have appropriate and effective poverty reduction strategies and  policy frameworks in place. In addition to supporting countries in their design  of policies, the PSI would provide a &quot;signal&quot; about the quality of those  policies to donors, the business community, and others. </p>
  <p><strong>PRGF financing  needs</strong></p>
  <p>    To ensure the  capacity of the PRGF to meet future needs, work is underway to estimate  medium-term demand for <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2005/032305.htm">PRGF financing</a>. This will take into account the implications of debt relief, and the  introduction of the PSI and the shocks window, as well as options for  increasing PRGF lending capacity. The IMF's Executive Board has emphasized the  close linkages between the financing of the Fund's concessional lending  operations and further debt relief, and has agreed that the institution needs  to be adequately equipped to meet future financing demands associated with its  role in supporting LICs. </p>

  <h2><a name="AMs" id="AMs">The 2005 Annual Meetings</a>:</h2>
  <h3><em><a name="debt" id="debt"></a>Governors  discuss debt relief, global imbalances, and low-income country issues </em></h3>
  <p>Endorsement of  the multibillion-dollar debt cancellation plan for the most heavily indebted  poor countries was one result of the September 24-25 IMF-World Bank Annual  Meetings. The meetings also addressed several other crucial international  issues. The finance ministers and central bank governors present warned that  widening global payments imbalances, and high and volatile oil prices posed  increased threats to the ongoing global expansion. They also welcomed proposed  new tools for IMF involvement in low-income countries (LICs), and endorsed a medium-term  strategy for the Fund proposed by Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato.</p>
  <p>The IMF's latest <em>World Economic Outlook</em>, projects global growth  of 4.3 percent for 2005 and 2006, which is close to the long-term trend rate, but  policymakers urged decisive steps to avoid disorderly adjustments in the global  economy. &quot;Global imbalances pose serious risks to prosperity,&quot; de Rato told the  Fund's Board of Governors. The International Monetary and Financial Committee  (IMFC), the IMF's ministerial policy steering committee, <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/cm/2005/092405e.htm">called </a> on oil  producers, consumers, and companies to cooperate to stabilize the oil market.  To tackle global imbalances, the IMFC urged the U.S. to increase national  savings through fiscal consolidation; emerging Asia to allow greater exchange  rate flexibility; and the euro area and Japan to implement further reforms to  enhance growth.</p>
  <p>The IMFC stressed  that a successful outcome to the Doha Round of trade liberalization is  essential for global growth and poverty reduction, and urged action to increase  market access, especially for developing countries; reduce trade-distorting  domestic support; eliminate all forms of export subsidies in agriculture; and  make progress on financial services and intellectual property rights.</p>
  <p>Along with the  agreement on debt relief, the Governors agreed that the IMF plays a critical  role in supporting low-income countries through policy advice, assistance with capacity  building, and financial assistance, and confirmed that the Poverty Reduction  and Growth Facility (PRGF)&#8212;the IMF's concessional loan facility&#8212;will remain the  main instrument for IMF financial support for these countries. In addition, the  IMFC approved two new instruments to strengthen Fund support for LICs. The  Policy Support Instrument (PSI) will be available to members that do not want  or need IMF financial assistance, but seek Fund assessment and endorsement of  their policies. And a new window in the PRGF Trust will be available to provide  timely financial support to PRGF countries facing exogenous shocks.</p>
  <p>The IMFC also  welcomed the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/2005/eng/091505.pdf">Managing Director's report on the IMF's  medium-term strategy</a>, agreeing that the Fund needs to deepen  its analysis of globalization. The strategy provides a framework for  prioritizing and focusing the Fund's work and increasing its effectiveness and  preparedness as it faces the future. It proposes specific actions to strengthen  its policy advice to member countries, improve technical assistance, and reform  the Fund's organization, structure, and work procedures. </p>

  <h3><a name="AMCS" id="AMCS"><em>Civil society dialogues at the  Annual Meetings</em></a></h3>
  <p>    Interactions between representatives of civil society  organizations (CSOs) and IMF staff at the 2005 Annual Meetings were shaped by  the G-8 debt relief proposal. The proposal and the latest HIPC initiative  report were the topic of a well-attended session as part of the civil society  dialogues organized by the IMF, World Bank and CSOs prior to the Annual  Meetings. The full list of dialogues as well as minutes of most sessions will  be available at <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/civilsociety">http://www.worldbank.org/civilsociety</a>. The dialogues climaxed at a Townhall meeting with World  Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, IMF Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato, and the  outgoing Chairman of the World Bank's Development committee, South African  Finance Minister Trevor Manuel.</p>
  <p><a href="#toc">Back  to Table of Contents</a>  </p>
  <p><a name="townhall" id="townhall"><strong>De Rato tells CSOs of  efforts on PRS, shocks window, voice and representation </strong></a></p>
  <p>    At the September 22 <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2005/tr050922a.htm">Townhall meeting </a> with CSOs, de Rato said the IMF is striving  to be more effective and better equipped in its work for low-income countries  (LICs) and is also aiming to be more responsive to new circumstances in a  changing world. The Managing Director outlined developments in policies  regarding LICs and the issue of voice and representation in the Fund.</p>
  <p>    De  Rato said the Fund has spent an intensive year working on subjects of interest  to CSOs. In tandem with the World Bank, the IMF has refined its approach  to countries' Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRS) to help ensure that these  strategies are home grown by member governments, and that expected results  are measurable. The Fund is also committed to incorporating into its analyses  the capacity of programs to help countries achieve the Millennium  Development Goals (MDGs). De Rato also described the work on <a href="#LIC">new instruments </a> designed to assist LICs. He also highlighted his  recommendation that the IMF needs to strengthen the voice of emerging-market  economies and African members in the Fund.  </p>
  <p>    Wolfowitz  told the CSO representatives there are four reasons CSOs were important to the  Bretton Woods institutions: first, they do things that governments either  cannot do or do not do very well. Second, CSOs in developing countries are an  important way of giving voice to the people and of giving people a chance to  hold their governments accountable, or their societies accountable. Third, CSOs  in developed countries and increasingly in developing countries can tell  international institutions what the effects of programs are and where they are  making mistakes. Fourth, CSOs have an advocacy role where they support  institutions in efforts to get governments to live up to their commitments and  promises. </p>
  <p>    Manuel  reminded the meeting that 2005 was the year the world was going to make poverty  history. With only 101 days left, a crisis of inaction loomed. The key  challenge is whether this year will be seen in retrospect as a year of wasted  opportunity instead of the year of development. Manuel said the UN Millennium Summit  had, in many respects, failed to live up to the expectations of the developing  world. But participants need to remain committed together because &quot;the  challenge of making poverty history is one that I don't think we should allow  to slip from our hands,&quot; Manuel said.</p>
  <p>    Questions  and comments from CSOs covered issues such as Iraq (also see <a href="#CSdialogue">article </a> on  Jubilee Iraq meeting), user fees for primary health  care, and debt relief. A full <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2005/tr050922a.htm">transcript </a> is  available at <a href="http://www.imf.org/">http://www.imf.org</a>. </p>

  <p><strong>Other  meetings</strong></p>
  <p>    On September 21, a panel discussion on <em>Accountability Within the Poverty Reduction  Strategies Approach</em> examined World Vision UK's report on <a href="http://www.worldvision.org.uk/resources/wvuk+prs+report+july.pdf">&quot;Poverty Reduction Strategies:  Are They Working?&quot; </a> and the World Bank/IMF <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPRS/0,,contentMDK:20343412~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:384201,00.html">2005 PRS Review</a>. Panelists were Fletcher Tembo of World Vision UK; Warren Nyamugasira of the  Uganda National NGO Forum; Linda van Gelder and Luca Barbone of the World  Bank's Poverty Reduction Group and Elliott Harris of the IMF Policy Development  and Review Department (PDR). Tembo and Nyamugasira  addressed whether the poverty reduction strategies can really engage the poor  and how to further involve civil society in the process. Harris and van Gelder provided  general recommendations for opening up greater policy dialogue space.</p>
  <p>    On September 22, <em>&quot;Bottom Line&quot; Perspective on the Doha  Development Agenda: &quot;Aid for trade,&quot; Enhancing National Revenues and Debt  Sustainability</em>, addressed the key elements of the Doha Agenda and how they  influence the mobilization of resources for poverty reduction. The session, moderated by  Liane Schalatek of the Heinrich Boell Foundation, focused on the need  for additional aid to support trade reforms adopted by developing nations to  strengthen trade competitiveness. Panelists included Nancy Alexander of the  Citizens' Network for Essential Services; Uri Dadush of the World Bank's Development  Prospects Group; Hans Peter Lankes of PDR; and Sony Kapoor, Senior Economic  Adviser at Jubilee Research. Dadush and Lankes emphasized that two World Bank  and IMF channels for trade liberalization assistance&#8212;the Integrated Framework  for Trade-Related Technical Assistance and the Multilateral Fund to Support  Trade&#8212;have enabled countries to pursue prudent policies that have in part  caused an income increase of 6 percent in developing nations since 2004.  Alexander and Kapoor were skeptical of the positive impact of policies that  encourage developing nations to open markets.</p>
  <p>    On September 22, PDR's Mark Plant led a session to discuss the recent work and papers on <em>The Role of the Fund in Low-Income Countries</em>.  IMF staff explained recent initiatives, including the new window in the PRGF  Trust to help LICs facing exogenous shocks; the new Policy Support Instrument;  and reviews of the IMF's role in the poverty-reduction process and the design  of PRGF-supported programs. Other IMF panelists included Patricia Alonso-Gamo, Mumtaz  Hussain, Abebe Selassie, and Simon Johnson (see <a href="#LIC">article </a> for an overview of these initiatives).</p>
  <p>    On September 22, Luca Barbone of the World Bank and  Robert Gillingham, of the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) Group in  the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department participated in the launch of the recent  Eurodad PSIA Advocacy Report. The panel discussed the results of a six-month  study of how the World Bank and development partners are carrying out PSIA work,  with reference to case studies from Ghana,  Mali, Vietnam and Nicaragua. The session was held at  the offices of InterAction, a consortium of U.S.-based NGOs. </p>
  <p>    On September 24, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois  Perrault and Michael Koch, of the World Bank's Resource Mobilization Department,  and Martine Guerguil and Mark Plant of PDR participated in <strong><em>The HIPC Initiative and the G-8 Debt Proposal</em></strong><strong>,</strong> to  discuss the recently published report, &quot;<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2005/081905.htm">Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)  Initiative&ndash;Status of Implementation</a>&quot; and to update  developments related to the debt proposal. The panel focused first on the HIPC  progress report, including the degree of participation by commercial and  non-Paris Club creditors, and the potential inclusion of new eligible countries.  Plant then summarized the issues under discussion at the IMF on the debt relief  proposal.</p>

  <h2><a name="parliament" id="parliament">IMF Parliamentary Outreach:</a> </h2>
  <h3><em>Legislators debate debt, trade, and other  issues</em></h3>
  <p>In a year marked  by promises of debt cancellation, more open trade, and more effective aid, what  role can parliamentarians play to ensure that commitments are honored so that  countries make progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)? How can  legislators bring the concerns of their domestic constituents to bear in the  global decision-making process? These were some of the challenges discussed by  parliamentarians at the sixth annual conference of the Parliamentary Network on  the World Bank (PNoWB), held in Helsinki  on October 21-23. The conference that brought together about 200 members of  parliament (MPs) from 90 countries.</p>
  <p>The gathering  produced a lively debate among the legislators, and with representatives of  civil society organizations, think tanks, multilateral agencies, as well as WTO  Director General Pascal Lamy, and World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz.  Representing the IMF were Thomas Dawson, Director of the External Relations  Department, Mark Plant, Senior Advisor in the Policy Development and Review  Department, and Parliamentary Liaison Sabina Bhatia. Dawson presented the IMF's <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/2005/eng/091505.pdf">Medium-Term Strategy</a>,  and Plant spoke on actions needed beyond 2005 to move countries toward  achieving the MDGs.</p>
  <p>President  Yudhoyono of Indonesia,  addressing participants via video link as the keynote speaker, said the  Millennium Development Goals are &quot;our best hope for humanity.&quot;. The MDGs are not  the brainchild of one country or group of countries and are not being imposed  by any country or group, he said. Rather, all countries have equal ownership of  the goals. The goals have universal relevance and the message to all countries  is that &quot;you are not alone, but are part of a global movement,&quot; Yudhoyono said.</p>
  <p>The G-8 debt  cancellation plan was uniformly welcomed, but the discussion revealed some  uneasiness. Expressing the view of many poor countries, Charles Mutasa of the African  Forum and Network on Debt and Development (AFRODAD) argued that the problem  with the original Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, and now with debt  cancellation, is that several countries with heavy debt burdens are not  included and therefore are unable to benefit. Expressing the view of the World  Bank, Vikram Nehru, Director of the Debt Department, said that depending on how  many countries are finally included, the cost to the World Bank's International  Development Association could be substantial and could jeopardize future  lending. Several speakers expressed the hope that no additional conditionality  would be attached to debt cancellation.</p>
  <p>Alison Johnson of  Debt Relief International called on parliamentarians from borrowing countries  to scrutinize carefully government spending to ensure that debt relief actually  helps countries progress toward the MDGs. Looking ahead, she said legislators  should monitor future borrowing to avoid the re-accumulation of unsustainable  debts. Mutasa suggested setting up a debt management office supervised by the  parliament. More generally, discussion of macroeconomic issues between  legislators and the government would be desirable, said the IMF's Mark Plant,  speaking at a later session. </p>
  <p>    Another central  topic at the conference was trade and the upcoming WTO ministerial meetings in Hong Kong. &quot;When two elephants fight, the grass ends up  suffering,&quot; observed Mutahi Kagwe, MP from Kenya,  describing worries about the current state of negotiations between the U.S.  and the EU over trade-distorting agricultural subsidies. WTO Director General  Pascal Lamy, speaking via video link, observed that the U.S. and EU were too far apart for  negotiations to progress. He warned that if the Hong Kong  meetings in December collapse, it will derail the chances of completing the  Doha Development Round by end-2006. Speaking at a different session, World Bank  President Paul Wolfowitz said that while it may be difficult for political  leaders in the industrialized nations to give up subsidies and other barriers to  free trade, this &quot;temporary discomfort is nothing compared with the daily  discomfort and deprivation faced by the world's poorest people.&quot; Bert Koenders,  MP from the Netherlands  and chair of PNoWB said that while legislators from different countries may have  divergent views on specific trade issues, it is important that they actively  debate these issues among themselves. At home, parliamentarians should  scrutinize carefully trade agreements and question their governments in  parliament, he said. </p>
  <p>The problem,  however, as several speakers noted, is lack of capacity. Legislators do not  have the resources or access to information to monitor and scrutinize the  actions of their governments. Frannie Leautier of the World Bank Institute  described the Institute's extensive parliamentary training program, and Peter  Koeppinger of the German foundation Konrad Adenauer Stiftung noted that his  organization provides extensive capacity building not only to parliamentarians  but also to legislative staff and political parties. Beatrice Kiraso, MP from Uganda,  said that while such training programs are useful, peer training&#8212;legislators  sharing experience and knowledge with one another&#8212;is even more valuable.</p>

  <h2><a name="CSdialogue" id="CSdialogue">Civil Society-IMF Dialogue:</a> </h2>
  <h3><em>Managing  Director de Rato meets with Jubilee Iraq</em></h3>
  <p>At the Annual Meetings <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2005/tr050922a.htm">Townhall </a>with  civil society organizations (see <a href="#townhall">article</a>), Jubilee  Iraq representative Maysa Ibrahim raised questions related to conditions that  might be attached to a future IMF arrangement with Iraq&#8212;especially the question  of fuel subsidies. After responding during the gathering, IMF Managing Director  Rodrigo de Rato invited Ibrahim to discuss the issue with him at a follow-up  meeting. </p>
  <p>At the September 26 meeting with de Rato  and Iraq mission chief Adam Bennett, Ibrahim asked about the possible removal  of Iraq's oil subsidies and how such a step could be reconciled with the  democratic process. De Rato acknowledged that conditions in Iraq are extremely difficult.  However, he said that the IMF's financial help since September 2004 (under the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/conflict.htm">Emergency Post Conflict Assistance </a> facility) has helped the economy. The IMF will start  working on a stand-by arrangement with Iraq, and even though the details  have not been worked out yet, he said that there are three priorities. The  first is that the Iraqi authorities will need to continue improving the  economic data they provide to the IMF. The second is an audit of the Central  Bank. The third is a shift from a policy of broad subsidies to a policy  focusing government support on the needy. Iraq spends the equivalent of 25 percent of GDP on oil  subsidies, or about US$8 billion a year. The major beneficiaries of these  subsidies are people who take the oil from Iraq,  where gasoline sells for 2 cents a liter, and sell it in Jordan for 50 cents. The current  subsidies are not targeted at the poor, but benefit those who are better off,  including speculators. De Rato said that the IMF is not asking the Iraqi  Government to immediately eliminate the subsidies, but to have a plan to reduce  them and use those resources for social policy. Ibrahim argued that oil  subsidies were the only means of distributing wealth in Iraq. De Rato said that he was  generally very happy to hear criticism on the issue of wealth distribution and  encouraged Jubilee Iraq to call on the Iraqi government to devote resources  from the subsidies to social programs. </p>
  <p>Ibrahim said that until now Jubilee Iraq  has seen no viable alternative to the subsidies. The group makes the case to  communicate to Iraqis what needs to be done in the country and to try to bring  the disenfranchised into this process. This buy-in is crucial, Ibrahim said, as  the current government is only transitional. If this government pushes reforms  through without buy-in, she added, the IMF might be seen as a vehicle of  economic occupation. The Managing Director emphasized that the IMF is not  asking to change the subsidy system because of budgetary pressures, but to use  it for social purposes and in a more direct and targeted way. </p>

  <h3><a name="labor" id="labor"><em>African  labor leaders discuss </em></a><em>Africa's development challenges</em> </h3>
  <p>Bassirou Sarr,  Center Coordinator for the IMF East Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center  (AFRITAC), participated in the 14th Congress of the African Regional  Organization of the International Confederation of the Free Trade Union  (ICFTU-AFRO) held in Tunis,   Tunisia on  September 28-30, 2005. The conference was attended by about 200 labor leaders  from 46 African countries, representatives from Asia, Europe and North America, and representatives from regional and  international organizations and civil society organizations. The main objective  of the congress was to review the activities of the ICFTU-AFRO and articulate a  medium-term vision for the African Trade Union movement. The central theme was Africa's development challenges and what unions can do to  address them. A vision paper entitled, &quot;Organizing, Development and Social  Justice: Challenges for the African trade Union Movement&quot; was discussed.</p>
  <p>The congress was  preceded by a two-day forum at which Sarr was invited to make a presentation on  one of the selected themes &quot;Making NEPAD Work for African Workers.&quot; The forum  was opened by Andrew Kailembo, ICFTU-AFRO's Secretary General, who<strong> </strong>welcomed the recent efforts by the New  Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)  Secretariat to involve trade unions in the dialogue on policies and to  institutionalize a tripartite consultative forum (NEPAD, government and labor)  as a framework for future relations. Sarr said that by subscribing to NEPAD, African  governments have emphasized their commitment to reforming public financial  management, thereby contributing to better governance, faster economic growth, and  poverty reduction. He stressed that progress in governance and economic and  financial management is essential to ensure a stable and productive environment  to attract the investment necessary for economic growth, and job creation, and  to encourage increased donor financing through budgetary support. While long-term  goals have been formulated in the areas of growth and poverty reduction,  insufficient attention has been given to formulating goals in public finance  management. He cited the two IMF regional technical assistance centers in Africa as an example of the IMF's work to help members  improve governance and public financial management. These centers play a very  specific role in providing advisory support and capacity building in three  specialized areas of competence: financial systems, public finances, and  macroeconomic statistics. All three areas are essential to underpin the broader  reform efforts in governance and economic and financial management. </p>
  <p>The forum was a good opportunity for Sarr  to discuss with union representatives the role of the Fund in debt relief and  its work with low-income<strong> </strong>members.<strong> </strong>Labor participants recognized that a  priority for the union movement will be to build the necessary capacity to  formulate alternative policies and take maximum advantage of the increased  opportunity for regular dialogue with international financial institutions.  While they agreed that substantial progress has been made in the dialogue, a lot  more needs to be done to enhance trade union participation in the Poverty  Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process, as well as influence the policy content  of the PRSPs.</p>

  <h3><a name="kenya" id="kenya"></a><em>Jurgen  Reitmaier, Senior Resident Representative in Kenya</em></h3>
  <p>On October 18, I was invited by the Kenya  Alliance of Resident Associations (KARA) to address their inaugural luncheon on  the subject of &quot;Civilian Oversight Over Government Expenditure and Government  Role in Economic Growth.&quot; KARA was founded in 1999 as an umbrella body for some  180 resident associations from across Kenya. KARA and its member  associations are engaged in advocacy on governance, environment, security,  water, land, and judicial issues. Publishing a weekly e-newsletter since the  beginning of this year, KARA has emerged as a serious interlocutor for central  and local government. The inaugural luncheon was attended by about 120  representatives of KARA member associations from different parts of the country  as well as special guests from government and donor organizations. In my  address, I stressed the need for civil society organizations to build their own  capacity to enable them to articulate realistic positions and engage government  effectively. Questions from participants focused on the governance challenges  of Kenya's  new Constituencies Development Fund (CDF), which was created in 2003 to boost  development spending at the constituency level. I agreed that problems existed  in the administration of the CDF, but I also noted that on many issues the  Government of Kenya sought the views of civil society and other stakeholders,  if not always with sufficient time for preparation and discussion.</p>

  <h3><a name="zambia" id="zambia"><em>Meetings with civil society and trade unionists  - Joseph Kakoza, Resident Representative in Zambia</em></a></h3>
  <p>    During the visit  of the IMF mission to Lusaka  in October 2005, meetings were arranged with members of civil society and trade  union representatives. Previous missions had held similar meetings with these  organizations. As debt issues and privatization policy had dominated past  meetings, the recent attainment of full HIPC debt relief and the prospect of  further relief from the multilateral debt relief initiative seemed to account  for a relaxed atmosphere that allowed for constructive discussions. <br />
    Discussions with the unions centered on proposed  labor law reforms and the need for reform in public sector pension schemes.  Trade unionists were anxious to see that public sector pension funds were put  back on a financially sound footing. Civil society organizations raised issues  relating to future debt management and contraction. They wanted laws and  institutions to be strengthened in order to avoid another debt overhang in the  future. While criticizing IMF conditionality in general, some representatives of  civil society organizations acknowledged that Fund conditionality resulted in  the strengthening of laws and institutions relating to debt management and said  that this seemed to be a step in the right direction.</p>

  <h3><a name="OtherMeetings" id="OtherMeetings"><em>Other recent meetings  between the IMF and CSOs</em></a></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>On September 7, Bethan  Emmett of Oxfam UK  and Hetty Kovach of Eurodad met with Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) staff,  Peter Heller, Marijn Verhoen, and David Coady, and with Andy Berg of the Policy  Development and Review Department (PDR) to discuss the macroeconomics of  scaling up resources to provide for basic health services. Kovach also  met with PDR's Mark Plant to clarify concerns related to the IMF's work in  low-income countries (LICs). </li>
    <li>Andy Berg of PDR and  Simonetta Nardin of EXR attended the 59th Annual Department of  Information (DPI)/ Non-governmental Organization Conference in New York on  September 9. Moderated by Pete Henriot of the Jesuit Centre for  Theological Reflection in Zambia,  Berg participated in a panel on <em>The UN,  the IMF and Millennium Development Goals</em>. Other speakers included Rathin  Roy, of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Vitalice Meja,  Director of the African Forum on Debt and Development. </li>
    <li>On September 13, EXR's Simonetta Nardin  participated in a panel discussion on <em>Economic  and Military Violence&#8212;IMF/World Bank Policies: Two Sides of the Same Coin</em> as part of the <em>Open UN Conference: One  Person, One Vote </em>organized bythe  Bridge Initiative International in collaboration with other organizations. The  conference provided an venue for representatives of civil society organizations  who were not able to attend the UN World Summit in September to examine issues  of global democracy, global governance and the efforts by multilateral institutions  to reduce poverty. </li>
    <li>Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato participated  in a panel session on <em>Breaking the  Impasse On Trade</em> as part of the Clinton Global Initiative conference in New York on September  15-17. De Rato emphasized the key role of trade liberalization in driving the  global economy and highlighted the responsibilities of both developed and  developing countries. In response to criticism of the WTO, he characterized the  organization as the appropriate venue for a rules-based multilateral approach  to trade liberalization and reform. The conference provided a setting for  discussion of broad issues and policy commitments towards poverty eradication,  religious and conflict reconciliation, climate change, and efforts to encourage  governance, enterprise and investment. </li>
    <li>On October 12, Klaus Enders and Luc Leruth of  the IMF Offices in Europe, attended a dialogue  on <em>International Trade Policies: Between  Globalization Discourse and Development Objectives</em>, organized by the Bridge  Initiative International. They discussed the protection of weaker trade  competitors in light of the Doha Round Negotiations. Other panelists  represented the World Bank, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the  Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), civil society  organizations and academia. Most participants recognized that a multilateral  agreement would be the only way to eliminate subsidies in OECD member countries,  but many CSO representatives were concerned that a Doha deal would reduce the  policy space in developing nations, for example the ability to explore  alternatives for the strengthening of competitiveness in their infant  industries. </li>
    <li>Mark Plant of PDR and  Linda Van Gelder of the World Bank participated in a symposium held in Geneva  on October 17-21 organized by the International Labor Organization's Bureau for  Worker's Activities, along with trade union leaders from 45 countries, representatives of the World Bank, UNCTAD<strong> </strong>and the ILO. Participants discussed  the role of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and the challenge to  eradicate poverty. Plant and Van Gelder presented the results of the Poverty  Reduction Strategies (PRS) Review and responded to questions on increased  participation by trade union representatives, macroeconomic policy and the PRS  Papers, country ownership of PRSs, structural adjustment and PRSs, as  well as employment and PRSs.</li>
    <li>EXR staffer Simonetta Nardin, and John Garrison  and Maya Brahmam of the World Bank's External Affairs Department gave brief  presentations on the role of the IMF and the World Bank to 14 representatives  from the NGO Fourth World Movement, on October 19. The visiting delegation was  interested in the relationship of the IMF and the Bank with Civil Society representatives  to promote fiscal and technical assistance that is country-driven by member  nations, as illustrated by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers.</li>
    <li> On  November 3, Peter Heller, FAD  Deputy Director, presented his paper, <em>Pity  the Finance Minister: Issues in Managing a Substantial Scaling Up in Aid Flows,</em> at a Center for Global Development Seminar, with Steve Radelet as the  discussant. Heller said that scaling up substantial aid flows will require  development partners to address many issues, including the impact of higher aid  flows on the competitiveness of aid recipients; the management of fiscal and  monetary policy; the delivery of public services; behavioral incentives; and  the change in economic growth rates. </li>
