			    Relations</i></p>
			  <p>The&nbsp;2005 Spring Meetings of the IMF and World
			    Bank provided an important opportunity to assess progress in the effort
			    to reduce global poverty, and offered an overview of the international
			    efforts to define the next stage of the poverty-reduction strategy. The
			    meetings followed the release of several key reports by the United Nations,
			    the British government, and the Bank and Fund themselves on the Millennium
			    Development Goals (MDGs) and related aid programs, especially in Africa.
			    At the meetings, various officials offered perspectives on the discussions
			    among donor countries on the future of overseas development assistance,
			    including debt relief (see, for example, the press conferences of IMF
			    Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato on <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2005/tr050414.htm">April&nbsp;14</a>,
			    and that of U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and the Managing
			    Director on <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2005/tr050416.htm">April&nbsp;16</a>).
			    Now, all eyes will be on a series of meetings that will take place before
			    the&nbsp;2005 IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings: the G-8 summit in Gleaneagles,
			    Scotland next June; the high-level dialogue at the UN under the auspices
			    of the Financing for Development program also in June; and the Millennium
			    Summit in September.</p>
			  <p>The&nbsp;2005 Spring Meetings coincided with several events involving
			    the IMF, World Bank and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). Apart from
			    the biennial Civil Society dialogues, IMF and World Bank staff participated
			    in a meeting with labor union leaders on Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers
			    (PRSPs) and participated in a multistakeholder dialogue with CSOs feeding
			    into the&nbsp;2005 PRSP review.</p>
			  <p>The Spring Meetings <a href="#P93_10360">Civil Society dialogues</a> covered
			    a wide range of topics, including the IMF's role in low-income countries;
			    resource revenue transparency in natural resource-rich countries; the
			    IMF's conditionality review; and the macroeconomics of HIV/AIDS. CSOs
			    attending these dialogues were also busy lobbying the G-7 countries for
			    movement on the campaign for additional debt relief. Even though no final
			    decision was taken in that regard, the communiqu&eacute;s of the G-7,
			    the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) and the Development
			    Committee reiterated the need for action regarding the MDGs. The <a href="#P77_5154">feature
			    article</a> reports on the IMFC meeting.</p>
			  <p>The technical meeting with labor unions was part of the regular dialogue
			    between the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and the labor
			    movement, with high-level meetings held every two years and technical
			    meetings focusing on specific issues held in the intervening years. The
			    last high-level meeting took place in October&nbsp;2004. Both Fund and
			    Bank staff and labor unions welcomed the session, as an <a href="#P123_18534">article</a> on
			    the meeting illustrates.</p>
			  <p>The largest event was the multistakeholder dialogue on the Poverty Reduction
			    Strategy (PRS) process, which involved around&nbsp;200 representatives
			    from CSOs, governments, parliaments, donor agencies and the Bank and Fund.
			    It was part of a World Bank-Civil Society Global Policy Forum that also
			    discussed World Bank-CSO relations. The <a href="#P135_22483">conference</a> will
			    feed into the&nbsp;2005 PRSP Review, an in-depth assessment of progress,
			    challenges, and good practices related to several key issues of the PRS
			    five years after the launch of the strategy.</p>

			  <p align="center"><a name="P77_5154"></a><i>Feature Article:</i></p>
			  <p><b><i><a name="P79_5170"></a>Report from the International Monetary and
			        Financial Committee</i></b></p>
			  <p>The International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), which brings
			    together 24 of the Fund's governors and other officials representing the
			    Fund's 184 member countries for high-level discussions of global economic
			    policy issues and IMF policies and operations, met April&nbsp;16 in Washington,
			    D.C. The meeting addressed the outlook for the global economy, IMF support
			    for low-income members' efforts to reduce poverty, and the Fund's strategic
			    direction.</p>
			  <p>The IMFC welcomed the continuing global expansion, which is expected
			    to continue through&nbsp;2005 and beyond. However, the committee also
			    noted that widening imbalances across regions and the continued rise in
			    oil prices and oil market volatility have increased the risks facing the
			    world economy. It concluded that the IMF's own policy consultations with
			    its members should focus on promoting policies for reducing global imbalances
			    over time; addressing the impact of higher oil prices, in particular on
			    the most vulnerable countries; managing the policy response to potential
			    inflationary pressures; and ensuring the sustainability of medium-term
			    fiscal frameworks.</p>
			  <p>The Committee particularly welcomed the recent strong growth in sub-Saharan
			    Africa, but noted with concern that most of the members in that region
			    are at risk of falling well short of the Millennium Development Goals
			    (MDGs). With improved macroeconomic stability in most countries, the IMFC
			    observed that the key challenge for these countries remains to press ahead
			    with reforms to strengthen the investment environment and foster private
			    sector-led growth. The global community, in turn, needs to support these
			    reform efforts through meeting commitments to increased and better coordinated
			    financial and technical assistance; further debt relief; policies to improve
			    remittance flows; and improved market access for developing countries.</p>
			  <p>The Committee underscored the conclusion of this year's IMF-World Bank
			    Global Monitoring Report that bold actions are urgently needed by the
			    developing countries and their partners to realize the MDGs. It said that
			    the U.N.&nbsp;Summit in September&nbsp;2005 will mark an important milestone
			    to review progress in this area and lay out actions going forward. The
			    IMFC said that the IMF has a critical role in supporting-through policy
			    advice, capacity building, and financial assistance, including debt relief-low-income
			    countries' efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability, debt sustainability,
			    and strong, sustainable high growth needed to make progress toward the
			    MDGs.</p>
			  <p>The IMFC noted that work is underway to refine the operational aspects
			    of the PRS approach, improve the design of programs under the Poverty
			    Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), and embrace alignment between PRGF-supported
			    programs and PRSs. This will be underpinned by more extensive analyses
			    of the sources of, and obstacles to, growth, and of the linkages between
			    growth and poverty reduction. The Committee looked forward to further
			    work to ensure adequate financing of the PRGF to meet future demands,
			    and other IMF instruments to assist low-income countries (LICs), including
			    to help members deal with shocks. It also looked forward to further work
			    on a policy monitoring arrangement to enhance the IMF's signaling role
			    for countries that do not need or want IMF financing.</p>
			  <p>While ministers agreed that more aid would be needed to help countries-particularly
			    in Africa-reach the MDGs, there was no consensus on how to mobilize those
			    additional financial resources. Various proposals were discussed, but
			    no decisions were taken. Decisions are expected later this year as other
			    international meetings proceed, including the G-8 summit at Gleneagles
			    in Scotland, the UN Summit in New York, and the IMF/World Bank Annual
			    Meetings in Washington D.C. in September.</p>
			  <p>On debt, the IMFC noted the recent progress in providing debt relief
			    under the HIPC initiative, and expressed its support for the joint IMF-World
			    Bank framework to help LICs achieve and maintain debt sustainability.
			    It welcomed the IMF's work and the preliminary discussion of key issues
			    regarding proposals for further multilateral debt relief and its financing
			    options, and called for further discussion with shareholders and examination
			    of these issues, including the possible use of the IMF's resources.</p>
			  <p>On the strategic direction of the Fund, the committee welcomed discussions
			    underway within the institution on a medium-term strategy and confirmed
			    that the central elements of the IMF's mandate under its Articles of Agreement
			    remain as important as ever. The Committee called for further work to
			    strengthen IMF consultations with member countries-called surveillance-and
			    its work on financial sector issues and international capital markets;
			    further reflection on the Fund's lending facilities; adaptation of Fund
			    policies to the needs of low-income countries; and improvement of internal
			    management standards. In addition, the IMFC said that adequate &quot;voice
			    and participation by all members must be assured, and distribution of
			    quotas should reflect developments in the world economy.&quot; </p>

			  <p>The civil society dialogues at the&nbsp;2005 IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings
			    covered a range of topics of interest to CSOs and the Bretton Woods Institutions
			    (BWIs), including the IMF's role in LICs, the IMF's conditionality review,
			    and the macroeconomics of HIV/AIDS. Many of the meetings were organized
			    by the IMF and World Bank, but several events were sponsored by CSOs and
			    other organizations. The regular dialogues also coincided with a labor
			    union technical meeting on the PRSP process (see <a href="#P123_18534">article</a>)
			    as well as the World Bank Civil Society Global Policy Forum (see <a href="#P135_22483">article</a>).

			  <p><b><i><a name="P97_11089"></a>CSOs and Nigerian minister welcome IMF
			        work on resource revenue transparency </i></b></p>
			  <p>During a panel discussion on transparency in extractive industries, Nigerian
			    Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and representatives from Global Witness
			    and Human Rights Watch discussed with IMF and World Bank staff the recently
			    published draft <i><a href="../../../../fad/2004/grrt/eng/index.html">Guide
			    on Resource Revenue Transparency</a>.</i> The April&nbsp;15 panel discussion
			    was moderated by Peter Heller, Deputy Director of the IMF's Fiscal Affairs
			    Department (FAD). </p>
			  <p>The IMF had <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2004/pr04274.htm">posted</a> the <i>Draft
			      Guide </i>for public comment in December&nbsp;2004, and comments submitted
			      were taken into account during the preparation of the final version
			      of the <i>Guide </i>(see <a href="021105.html#P174_25988">Civil
			      Society Newsletter February&nbsp;2005</a>). In the <i>Guide</i> IMF
			      staff said institutional strengthening to improve transparency in resource-rich
			      countries should provide an ample payoff for a relatively modest investment.
			      Transparency of current revenue transactions is an area in which many
			      low and middle-income countries can make immediate, visible progress,
			      if necessary with technical support, it said.</p>
			  <p>Diarmid O'Sullivan, campaigner with Global Witness's oil campaign, said
			    the NGO has some reservations but likes the <i>Guide</i>, believing it
			    is the clearest and most comprehensive articulation of the information
			    that needs to be in the public domain, and of needed oversight measures.
			    Global Witness also says it approves of the way the <i>Guide</i> does
			    not limit the freedom of governments to choose their own policies, and<i> </i>the<i> Guide's</i> understanding
			    that both oil and mining companies that pay revenues and governments that
			    receive the revenues have a responsibility to be transparent. </p>
			  <p>Arvind Ganesan, business and human rights director at Human Rights Watch,
			    said the IMF has taken a &quot;really progressive stance on transparency
			    and ... a very positive line with governments ... to push their practices
			    forward.&quot; He said the guide is a good starting point-provided it
			    actually is implemented. The key is that there be a minimum commitment
			    to transparency across the board, regardless of country, Ganesan said. </p>
			  <p>Finance Minister Okonjo-Iweala said that implementing resource revenue
			    transparency is at the center of an anticorruption drive in Nigeria. Her
			    country's government has tried, since its election in&nbsp;1999, to be
			    clearer than in the past about the role and responsibility of government
			    in the resource sector. Okonjo-Iweala said the Nigerian government's transparency
			    drive is not an isolated effort, but part of an overall reform program
			    that includes improved public expenditure management; privatization; public
			    sector reform; and banking reforms. She said Nigeria is trying hard to
			    overcome a reputation of corruption and mismanagement, including improper
			    use of its natural resources.</p>
			  <p>In the Nigerian government's effort to put in place reforms that can
			    turn the economy around and enable the private sector to create jobs,
			    fighting corruption and improving transparency are key goals, Okonjo-Iweala
			    added. She said the <i>Guide's</i> reference to institutional strengthening
			    and improved transparency providing significant benefits to government
			    and taxpayers precisely captures Nigeria's recent experience. Okonjo-Iweala
			    also noted that oil is the center of the Nigerian economy, providing over
			    75&nbsp;percent of government revenues and comprising 90&nbsp;percent
			    of exports. Since corrupt behavior has affected the oil sector in the
			    past, the government must improve the transparency of its revenues.</p>

			      of the book, and Shanta Devarajan, Chief Economist in the South Asia
			      Region of the World Bank, led the discussion and presented their findings
			      to CSOs. Also see an article on the book in the <a href="021105.html#P121_15858">Civil
			      Society Newsletter February&nbsp;2005.</a></li><br>
<br><li>Mark Plant, Senior Advisor in the IMF's Policy Development and
			    Review Department (PDR) and other staffers from PDR and FAD on April&nbsp;20
			    gave an update on the IMF's role in low-income countries and how it fits
			    into the current political climate surrounding the MDGs and the new debt
			    relief proposals by the G-7. He said that while these proposals now have
			    to be discussed by donor governments before any action can be taken, CSOs
			    should not forget that for a small number of countries, the HIPC initiative
			    is not fully financed yet.</li><br>
<br><li>Also on April&nbsp;20, Tessa van der Willigen and Atish R. Ghosh,
			    Advisor and Division Chief, respectively, in PDR gave an update on the&nbsp;2004-05
			    review of IMF conditionality policy, which consists of three components: <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/2004/eng/design.htm">design
			    of Fund-supported programs</a>, <a href="http://www.imf.org/External/np/pp/eng/2005/030305.htm">review
			    of the application of the&nbsp;2002 conditionality guidelines</a>, and
			    how these complement the review of Bank-Fund collaboration. CSOs were
			    mostly interested in how the&nbsp;2002 conditionality guidelines have
			    affected IMF conditionality in practice. Speakers said that although it
			    is still too early for an evaluation of the implementation of the guidelines,
			    many changes are already apparent.</li><br>
<br><li>Thomas Dalsgaard, FAD Senior Economist, on April&nbsp;14 participated
			    in the panel discussion &quot;The Budget Woes of Developing Countries:
			    Can they Afford More Trade Liberalization?&quot;, organized by the Heinrich
			    B&ouml;ll Foundation (B&ouml;ll) and the Center of Concern. Other panel
			    participants included B&ouml;ll's Liane Schalatek; Rosario Guzman, President
			    of the IBON Foundation in the Philippines; Sony Kapoor of the International
			    Tax Justice Network and Tobin Tax Network; and Antoine Heuty of the United
			    Nations Development Programme.</li><br>
<br><li>A group of legislators and CSOs on April&nbsp;15 presented two
			    petitions (or two versions of a petition) to the Fund and Bank calling
			    on IMF and World Bank Executive Directors to ensure that parliamentarians
			    are fully involved in economic decisions affecting their countries. Eight
			    lawmakers, from Argentina, Brazil, Ghana, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Malawi,
			    and the U.K., presented the petition, an initiative by a group of CSOs.
			    It had been signed by about 1,000 parliamentarians (of whom about half
			    are from Europe). IMF and World Bank staff had been aware of <a href="http://www.pnowb.org/html/modules/UpDownload/store_folder/Conferences/PNoWB_Petition_FINAL.pdf">one
			    version</a> of the petition, while a <a href="http://www.ippinfo.org/uk/petitioneng.htm">different-and
			    more critical-one</a> was also presented at the meeting. Each had different
			    sets of signatures. The legislators, representing the International Parliamentarians'
			    Petition for Democratic Oversight of IMF and World Bank Policies, met
			    with IMF and World Bank staff. The petition was accepted by Thomas Dawson,
			    Director of the IMF's External Relations Department, and Ian Goldin, the
			    World Bank's Vice-President for External Affairs.</li>

			    of the PRSP approach</a>. </p>
			  <p>The meeting was part of the regular dialogue between the IFIs and labor
			    unions; high-level meetings are held every two years and technical meetings
			    focusing on specific issues are held in the intervening years. The last
			    high-level meeting took place in October&nbsp;2004 (see story in the <a href="../2004/111604.html">November&nbsp;2004
			    issue of the CSO newsletter</a>). A summary of that discussion can be
			    found at: <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2004/pr04212.htm">http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2004/pr04212.htm</a>. </p>
			  <p>In the first session of the day-long meeting with labor unions, IMF and
			    World Bank representatives reviewed the outcome of the Spring Meetings,
			    particularly with regard to low-income country issues (see <a href="#P77_5154">feature
			    article</a>).</p>
			  <p>The second session focused on the PRSP review. Fund and Bank staff reviewed
			    the experience with the PRS process over the first five years of implementation,
			    and outlined some of its achievements and weaknesses. They noted that
			    the approach had helped to strengthen countries' focus on poverty reduction
			    efforts, but that it needed to provide a better framework for creating
			    growth and making progress on the MDGs. Some preliminary findings of the
			    review indicated that this required, among other things, a stronger medium-term
			    orientation, better prioritization, broader and deeper participation of
			    stakeholders, and improved donor coordination mechanisms.</p>
			  <p>Trade union representatives focused their presentations on how to achieve
			    more meaningful participation, particularly of labor. They said studies
			    and examples from individual country cases indicated that trade union
			    consultation and participation in the elaboration of PRSPs had been uneven;
			    the representatives said that it was rare at the implementation, monitoring,
			    and evaluation stages. This was largely due to deficient participation
			    structures and processes in many countries, but sometimes also to a lack
			    of technical capacity on the part of unions that detracted from their
			    ability to contribute. The trade union representatives suggested several
			    actions to enhance the quality of the participatory process and trade
			    unions' capacity to help improve the reflection of trade union concerns
			    in final PRSPs. </p>
			  <p>In the third session, a representative from the International Labor Organization's
			    Bureau for Worker's Activities (ILO-ACTRAV) presented a study of trade
			    union involvement in PRSPs, based on pilot country cases. Among ACTRAV's
			    recommendations was to institute formal mechanisms for participation,
			    on a tripartite model involving workers, employers, and government, and
			    place the goals of &quot;decent work&quot;-including employment, social
			    protection, rights, and social dialogue-at the heart of PRSP discussions
			    and strategies.</p>
			  <p>Speakers at the concluding session broadly welcomed the fact that the
			    PRSP approach had increased attention to the issue of poverty reduction,
			    and had led to greater involvement of stakeholders in national discourses
			    on the best way to achieve that goal. They generally agreed, however,
			    that the approach needed to be refined in various ways, including to improve
			    the quality of participation by civil society, and better reflect &quot;decent
			    work&quot; objectives. IMF and WB staff welcomed the dialogue with the
			    trade unions, and noted that their views would be considered and reflected
			    in the final report on the PRSP review, which will be ready by the Fall.</p>

			  <p><b><i><a name="P135_22483"></a>IMF and World Bank staff review PRS process
			        in multistakeholder dialogue </i></b></p>
			  <p>Some&nbsp;200 representatives from civil society, governments, parliaments,
			    donor agencies and the Bank and Fund came together in Washington in late
			    April to assess the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process. The conference
			    was part of the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/prspreview">2005 Review</a>,
			    an in-depth assessment of progress, challenges, and good practice related
			    to several key issues of the PRS five years after their launch. Civil
			    society organizations (CSOs) from over 50 countries attended, representing
			    labor unions, NGOs, faith-based groups, foundations, and community-based
			    organizations. </p>
			  <p>After opening remarks by Mark Plant, Senior Advisor in the IMF Policy
			    Development and Review Department (PDR), and Luca Barbone, Director of
			    the Poverty Reduction Group at the World Bank, and a presentation by Bank
			    and Fund staffs on the review and the key challenges faced in the 70 countries
			    implementing PRS, participants attended eight separate roundtables to
			    concentrate on key questions such as the availability of poverty data,
			    relations with a country's Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF-the
			    budgetary translation of the PRS' medium-term objectives and the framework
			    for the formulation of annual budgets), donor harmonization, and CSO participation
			    in the PRS process. </p>
			  <p>Each roundtable included country-based expertise from government officials,
			    CSO representatives, parliamentarians, and PRS staff from donor agencies.
			    From the IMF, Elliott Harris, Patricia Alonso-Gamo, Thomas Dorsey and
			    Louis Dicks-Mireaux from PDR, as well as Robert Gillingham from the Fiscal
			    Affairs Department and Benedict Clements from the Western Hemisphere Department,
			    participated in the roundtables. </p>
			  The recommendations made by the working groups during the day, which
			    will feed directly into the Review, included: <ul><li>Greater policy coherence among donors and programmatic accountability
			    by governments in order to improve the poverty impacts of the PRSPs;</li><br>
<br><li>Deepened quality of civil society participation; currently there
			    is a widespread sense that CSO input is not reflected in the final versions
			    of PRSPs;</li><br>
<br><li>Greater attention to monitoring and evaluation, including consideration
			    of a wider set of policy and analytical alternatives.</p>

			        After Hurricane Ivan</i></b></p>
			  <p>Grenada, a small island nation in the Caribbean, was devastated on September&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2004,
			    by Hurricane Ivan. Ninety&nbsp;percent of houses on the island were damaged
			    or destroyed. The overall damage was estimated at twice the country's
			    annual income. This far exceeds the damage of 2&nbsp;percent of annual
			    income that natural disasters have, on average, inflicted on countries
			    over the last three decades. The utter devastation of the country brought
			    forth tremendous support from the international community, particularly
			    civil society groups. </p>
			  <p>On February&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2005, the IMF and the World Bank joined the
			    National Coalition on Caribbean Affairs (<a href="http://www.ncoca.org/">www.ncoca.org</a>)
			    to discuss Grenada's recovery some six months after Ivan struck and the
			    lessons learnt for disaster relief efforts in general. Prakash Loungani,
			    the IMF's mission chief to Grenada, said that the economic situation remained
			    very difficult. About 8&nbsp;percent of the labor force had lost their
			    jobs, mainly from tourism and agriculture, as a result of the effect of
			    the hurricane, bringing the country's unemployment rate to over&nbsp;20&nbsp;percent.
			    While men were getting absorbed in reconstruction and fishing, women were
			    finding it tougher to get new jobs. Donor agencies and civil society groups
			    were trying to address the providing training for women in construction
			    and home repair. There was also a severe need for &quot;helping people
			    come to grips&quot; with the trauma of the hurricane through counseling, &quot;particularly
			    as the next hurricane season approaches.&quot; </p>
			  <p>Caroline Anstey, the World Bank's country director for the Caribbean,
			    added that in Grenada, as elsewhere in the Eastern Caribbean region, the
			    country's huge public debt adds to the precariousness of the economic
			    situation. &quot;This is essentially going to be a problem for all the
			    people of the region because it is their debt. It will be passed down
			    to their children, and their children's children. I think that there is
			    a need for a real dialogue on the debt issue in the Caribbean,&quot; Anstey
			    said.</p>
			  <p>On the lessons learned from Grenada, Anstey said the success of relief
			    and rehabilitation efforts there shows &quot;the need to involve civil
			    and community groups ... reconstruction can be coordinated top down, but
			    it really needs to take place bottom up to energize the community.&quot; She
			    mentioned, as an example, the work of faith-based NGOs in helping with
			    the reconstruction of churches. </p>
			  <p>Grenada's ambassador to the United States, Denis G. Antoine, said his
			    country still needed help to achieve its goal to &quot;Build Back Better.&quot; He
			    asked CSOs and others to keep &quot;Grenada's name in the news and in
			    the international community&quot; so that this help would be forthcoming.
			    Without such public attention, &quot;the Grenadas of the world would remain
			    marginalized based on their lack of economic might.&quot;</p>

			        to charities in developing countries </i></b></p>
			  <p>In May&nbsp;2005, 41 international charities received awards from the
			    IMF's Civic Program Advisory Committee (CPAC), which is made up of 12
			    representatives drawn from staff, spouses and partners, retirees, and
			    volunteers from <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/cpac/involve.htm">INVOLVE</a> (a
			    grassroots volunteer group started by IMF staff). CPAC supports programs
			    that assist persons facing low-income, socially dependent, and other detrimental
			    and dysfunctional situations. The selected organizations are from a variety
			    of countries, including China, Guatemala, Mali, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines,
			    Senegal, Togo, Ukraine, the West Bank and Gaza Territories, and Zambia.
			    The other half of the 82 total grantees are organizations from the Washington,
			    D.C. area that are providing social services in the IMF's host city. (See
			    guidelines and past recipients at <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/cpac/cpindex.htm">www.imf.org/external/np/cpac/cpindex.htm</a>.)</p>
			  <p>Since its founding in&nbsp;1994, CPAC has given money to nearly 134 charities
			    globally. It is managed by the Civic &amp; Community Relations Office
			    of the IMF's External Relations Department. CPAC's activities also include
			    employee contributions through the &quot;Helping Hands&quot; Campaign
			    and fundraising for humanitarian relief efforts. Fund management personally
			    presents donations to charitable organizations when visiting member countries.
			    (See the &quot;<a href="#P188_30422">letter from the field</a>&quot; on
			    the Managing Director's visit to India). Donations have placed an emphasis
			    on HIV/AIDS awareness programs, orphanages, rural health clinics, and
			    primary schools. For its fundraising efforts in&nbsp;2004, the IMF received
			    the &quot;Champion of Health Award&quot; from the Community Health Charities

			    two social development projects: a primary education learning center and

			    access to education and health is necessary. By visiting these social
			    development projects, de Rato could see first hand what many have called

			  <p><b><i><a name="P200_33124"></a>Afghanistan. NGOs in a changing environment </i></b><br>
			  <b><i>Bruno de Schaetzen, Resident Representative, Kabul, Afghanistan</i></b></p>
			  <p>Non-government organizations (NGOs) have played a unique role in Afghanistan
			    over the last two decades in terms of the scope of their work, the contribution
			    to alleviating poverty and meeting humanitarian needs, and the harsh conditions
			    under which they had to operate. Over the last three years, however, the
			    fall of the Taliban regime, the subsequent massive inflows of external
			    assistance, and the establishment of a freely elected government, have
			    required a reassessment of this role. Lately, this has led to uneasy relations
			    between the government and the NGO community. Fund and World Bank staff,
			    together with representatives of the donor community, have sought to mediate
			    and assist in establishing a new relationship. </p>
			  <p>When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in&nbsp;1979, most donors and
			    international development institutions were forced to leave. Only a handful
			    of dedicated international NGOs (INGOs) continued to operate. As civil
			    war swept over the country with the ending of the Soviet occupation, few
			    of the official development agencies were able to return. It was again
			    left to a few committed INGOs to address the deepening social needs and,
			    under often gravely dangerous and difficult circumstances, to try to compensate
			    for the shortfall in even the most basic government services. Their activities
			    quickly expanded, and they often became the de facto voice of the international
			    community in Afghanistan.</p>
			  <p>In parallel, a vigorous national NGO community flourished for three main
			    reasons. First, during the period of mudjahedin resistance to the Soviets,
			    various self-help organizations emerged to assist the refugee population
			    in Pakistan with basic welfare services. These organizations continued
			    and expanded their activities upon their return to Afghanistan. Second,
			    many Afghans in exile organized themselves to help alleviate the deep
			    sufferings of refugees and the population in the country. A third factor
			    was a legal and tax framework in Afghanistan that deeply repressed private
			    sector activities, an enduring legacy of the Soviet occupation. The successive
			    civil war governments were too overtaken by other problems to address
			    the matter, while the Taliban felt no need to stimulate for-profit activities
			    under their theocratic approach to economic management. Therefore, setting
			    up an NGO became virtually the only practical way to conduct private economic
			    activities. By the end of the Taliban regime the NGO sector had taken
			    on an extraordinary importance in the Afghan economy, with a contribution
			    estimated at over 30&nbsp;percent of non-opium GDP. It was also virtually
			    the only provider of social services. In&nbsp;2001 essentially all the
			    girls who were receiving an education did so in schools set up by NGOs.
			    Most of the health clinics and dispensaries were run by NGOs. In some
			    areas even infrastructure such as roads and bridges were being build by
			    NGOs. </p>
			  <p>Paradoxically, the growth and importance of the sector accelerated after
			    the fall of the Taliban. Many NGOs became implementing partners for large
			    donor assistance programs as their knowledge, experience, and existing
			    structures made them a cost-effective and quick vehicle to provide aid.
			    New INGOs arrived and diaspora Afghans intensified their efforts to assist
			    in the reconstruction process and help refugees return. Finally, with
			    little progress in establishing a supportive private sector environment
			    and few restrictions to obtaining NGO status, many entrepreneurs set up
			    NGOs to take advantage of the new economic opportunities.</p>
			  <p>As a result, there are currently about 2,500 registered national and
			    international NGOs, with a majority of the national NGOs thought to be
			    business ventures. For example, most of the domestic constructions companies
			    are NGOs. As President Karzai's government takes on the task of rebuilding
			    national institutions, it has become clear that reforming the NGO sector
			    is a priority. The government's concerns are threefold. First, in order
			    to gain authority and legitimacy in the whole country, it is critically
			    important to be seen as responsible for the provision of basic social
			    and community services. However, the government does recognize that its
			    present low level of capacity requires a progressive approach to avoid
			    causing further distress by cutting off the few available social services.
			    Second, an important element of the government's economic development
			    strategy is to foster a competitive private sector. It feels that many
			    NGOs-even the legitimate ones-are competing unfairly with a nascent business
			    sector. Third, it has given paramount importance to establishing a sustainable
			    and equitable revenue basis. Closing the tax loopholes created by businesses
			    registering as NGO is an important step in its efforts to achieve this.</p>
			  <p>These reform intentions have lately led to strains between the government
			    and the NGO community. Tensions were unfortunately aggravated by activists
			    who sought to capitalize on the perceived unpopularity of NGOs that have
			    been accused of profligate spending of aid assistance-including for extravagant
			    life styles-and lack of unaccountability. This has incited attacks in
			    the media that do not distinguish between responsible NGOs and others.
			    It also has led to the preparation of a draft NGO law with what some observers
			    regard as unfair and unrealistic restrictions on groups' activities, particularly
			    at a time when the government itself has a limited capacity to implement
			    projects or provide public services.</p>
			  <p>The response of the legitimate NGO community, notably led by the Agency
			    Coordination Body for Afghan Relief (ACBAR), has been to call for legislation
			    that recognizes and supports the role of legitimate NGOs in Afghanistan's
			    development; for a process of re-registration of NGOs; and for donors
			    to recognize the ongoing need for transitional funding mechanisms. ACBAR
			    points out that its members have already largely shifted their programming
			    focus from being the sole providers of basic services to emphasizing their
			    role as facilitators and implementers of priority government programs.
			    It has also called on its members to recognize that as government capacity
			    increases, their own programming must evolve. The group says that the
			    mix of NGO activities should give more emphasis to civil society capacity
			    building. Finally, ACBAR has insisted on a voluntary code of conduct for
			    its members that, among other things, requires them to use independent
			    evaluations and audits to become fully accountable to governments, donors
			    and the people of Afghanistan. </p>
			  <p>The Fund mission in Afghanistan has paid close attention to the impact
			    that these issues have on many important aspects of the Staff Monitored
			    Program. The mission chief, Steve Symansky, other mission members and
			    I have began a dialogue with the NGO community, notably with the management
			    and members of AKBAR. We have also been coordinating with other representatives
			    of the international community, notably the World Bank. Fiscal experts
			    from the Fund have provided advice to the government on a new NGO law.
			    Measures to create a supportive environment for private business have
			    been made an integral part of the Fund program. It is expected that work
			    on these issues will intensify in the months to come, notably as part
			    of the preparation of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and in the process
			    of adjusting the National Development Strategy</p>

			        on sabbatical in Conakry, Guinea</i></b></p>
			  <p>While on an IMF sabbatical in Conakry, Guinea, where my husband Dennis
			    Jones is the IMF's Resident Representative, I am engaged in an independent
			    study on the Fund's role in helping poor countries achieve the MDGs. Last
			    month, I attended Guinea's launch of the Millennium Project's Report to
			    the UN Secretary General <i>Investing in Development: A Practical Plan
			    to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals</i>. The report was well received
			    by Guinea's Prime Minister, Cellou Dalein Diallo, who noted that Guinea's
			    own poverty had recently spiked upwards from 42 to 49&nbsp;percent of
			    the population living on less than a dollar a day. He pledged to put the
			    wheels in motion to prepare Guinea's needs assessment in order to begin
			    the process of trying to achieve the MDGs by&nbsp;2015. While not involved
			    in Guinea's policy matters (Dennis has his hands full), I have the opportunity
			    to see and work first hand with the country's poor in my spare time. My
			    favorite outreach is at an orphanage that houses 24 children between the
			    ages of 18 months and 17 years. The home is officially financed by a German
			    NGO, <i>Children for a Better World</i>. As one of several women who drop
			    by once a week to lend moral support-play, nurture, talk and help out-we're
			    trying to bring hope to these children.</p>
