<h1>Proposals for a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM)</h1>

       
      
<div class="introParagraph"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p>The IMF's crisis prevention efforts are aimed at reducing the number 
        of financial crises over time, but it is unrealistic to expect that all 
        member countries will be able to avoid all crises all of the time. In 
        rare instances where countries amass unsustainable debt burdens, they 
        must restructure their obligations. Currently, the international financial 
        system lacks a strong legal framework for the predictable and orderly 
        restructuring of sovereign debt, which drives the cost of default even 
        higher. The IMF is trying to create a framework for an equitable debt 
        restructuring that restores sustainability and growth, without including 
        incentives that unintentionally increase the risk of default.</p>
      
<p>In September 2002, the International Monetary and Financial Committee 
        (IMFC) endorsed the Fund's work and requested the IMF to develop a concrete 
        SDRM proposal for consideration at the April 2003 Spring meetings.</p></td></tr></table></div>
      
<h2>What is the problem?</h2>
      
<p>In recent years countries have turned increasingly from bank loans to 
        bond issues to raise capital. As a result, the international capital markets 
        are more diversified and function more efficiently. Specifically, there 
        is a broader investor base available to provide financing for emerging 
        market sovereigns, which has helped diversify risk. But there is a serious 
        downside if a country faces unsustainable debt. Private creditors have 
        become increasingly numerous, anonymous and difficult to coordinate. This 
        problem is exacerbated by the variety of debt instruments involved and 
        the range of legal jurisdictions in which debt is issued. When faced with 
        a restructuring, individual creditors, unlike banks, have more incentives 
        to hold out for the best possible terms, or to sue for better terms. Also, 
        disagreement over the relative treatment of different types of creditors 
        are more likely.</p>
 
      

      
<p>Countries facing severe liquidity problems go to extraordinary lengths 
        to avoid restructuring their debts to foreign and domestic creditors because 
        they know that even an orderly debt restructuring can damage their economy 
        and banking system. Moreover, a disorderly restructuring can sever access 
        to private capital for years, leading to crisis. As a result, countries 
        with unsustainable problems wait too long before confronting them, which 
        is harmful to the country, its citizens and the entire international community.</p>
      
<h2>What is the solution?</h2>
      
<p>Better incentives for debtors and creditors to agree on prompt, orderly 
        and predictable restructuring of unsustainable debt are needed. Domestic 
        bankruptcy law serves as a useful model in the insolvency context, but 
        the applicability of the corporate model is limited by the unique characteristics 
        of a sovereign state. Considerable work has been done to identify &quot;best 
        practices&quot; in core areas. Properly adapted, many of the following 
        key features could be incorporated into the design of a sovereign debt 
        restructuring mechanism (&quot;SDRM&quot;).</p>
      
<p><strong>Majority restructuring</strong>&#8212;The mechanism would allow a sovereign 
        and a qualified majority of creditors to reach an agreement that would 
        then be made binding on all creditors that are subject to the restructuring.</p>
      
<p><strong>Deter disruptive litigation</strong>&#8212;The mechanism would discourage 
        creditors from seeking to enhance their position through litigation during 
        the restructuring process. The current SDRM proposal does not include 
        an automatic stay on the enforcement of creditor rights. Rather any amounts 
        recovered by a creditor through litigation would be deducted from its 
        residual claim under an approved restructuring agreement (through the 
        application of the so-called &quot;Hotchpot rule&quot;).</p>

<p><strong>Protecting creditor interests</strong>&#8212;An SDRM would need to include 
        safeguards that give creditors adequate assurances that their interests 
        are being protected during the restructuring process.</p>
      
<p><strong>Priority financing</strong>&#8212;As a means of inducing new financing, 
        an SDRM could exclude a specified amount of new financing from the restructuring, 
        if such exclusion were supported by a qualified majority of creditors.</p>
      
<h2>Going forward</h2>
      
<p>In April 2002 the IMFC endorsed the IMF's view of the problem and encouraged 
        it to investigate a &quot;twin-track&quot; approach to solving it.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> 
        The first, a statutory approach, would create a legal framework that would 
        allow a qualified majority of a country's creditors to approve a restructuring 
        agreement which would be binding on all. In order to make the agreement 
        binding on all creditors, enactment of a universal statutory framework 
        would be necessary. The second approach would incorporate comprehensive 
        restructuring clauses, so-called &quot;collective action clauses,&quot; 
        in debt instruments. Collective action clauses, found in sovereign bond 
        contracts, limit the ability of dissident creditors to block a widely-supported 
        restructuring on an individual bond issue. </p>
      
<p>Both approaches have been subject to intense and constructive debate, 
        within the Fund and in other fora, throughout 2002. The IMFC reviewed 
        progress at its September 2002 meeting.</p>
      
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
      
<p>Reforming the sovereign debt restructuring framework is a formidable 
        task that will take many years to develop and implement. These reforms 
        are just one part of the IMF's larger effort to </p>
      
<p>improve crisis management, and are intended to complement crisis prevention 
        and crisis management efforts undertaken in response to the market turmoil 
        in the late 1990s. Those reforms include: revamping of existing lending 
        tools; examining the analytical framework it uses to assess debt sustainability; 
        and clarifying the Fund's policy on the access members have to IMF lending. 
        The result will be better allocation of global capital and a stronger, 
        more stable, and more efficient international financial system. </p>

<h2><a name="a"></a>A. Nature of the Problem</h2>
      
<p><em><a name="a1"></a>A.1 What problems is the SDRM proposal trying to 
        solve?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> A country (`sovereign&quot;) sometimes finds itself, through some 
          combination of bad luck and bad policies, with an unsustainable debt 
          burden. A sovereign debt is unsustainable when, under any realistic 
          set of policies and circumstances that can be envisaged, the debt-to-GDP 
          ratio (or debt-to-export ratio in some cases) will rise without limit. 
          In such cases, one way or another, the country's debt have to be restructured&#8212;that 
          is, the net present value of the debt will have to be reduced relative 
          to its face value.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>But the process of restructuring is costly and painful, and so a country's 
          policymakers typically delay entering into a discussion with their creditors. 
          Often, the debtor country resorts to last ditch policies that make the 
          situation worse and the ultimate adjustment even more difficult. Ordinary 
          people can end up paying a tremendous economic and social cost as a 
          result. Creditors are also damaged by these delays, since the value 
          of their claims would be better preserved if the economic dislocation 
          in the debtor country were less severe.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>In addition, uncertainty about how the situation in one country is 
          going to resolve itself often spills over to the market valuation of 
          debt and assets of other emerging markets and developing countries.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> Such a situation can leave the IMF, and the international community 
          more broadly, with two unpalatable options: either withhold official 
          financial assistance and let the country sink further into a state of 
          crisis, or try to assist it with an IMF-supported program&#8212;even 
          though the odds of the program's success may have been greatly reduced 
          by the delay in dealing with the debt problem.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> Delays in carrying out restructurings in large part result from the 
          growing complexity of international financial markets and the increasing 
          diversity of creditors. Difficulties can arise in several areas, including: 
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Collective action</strong>: A restructuring solution that is acceptable 
              to the majority of creditors can be vetoed by one or a few minority 
              creditors who wish to &quot;hold out&quot; for more favorable terms 
              for themselves. <br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Creditor coordination</strong>: Governments of emerging markets 
              now issue debt to a diffuse group of creditors with diverse economic 
              interests, in different legal jurisdictions, and using a variety 
              of instruments. It is difficult to get all of the creditors into 
              a room and hammer out a solution that is acceptable to all.<br />
              <br />
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The SDRM proposal would fill a gap in the international financial 
          system by providing a framework to help resolve such problems. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="a2"></a>A.2 What are the objectives of the SDRM?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> The central objective is to put countries and their creditors in 
          a better position to restructure unsustainable sovereign debts in an 
          orderly and timely manner. The SDRM would provide the legal basis for 
          creditors, in particular, to do so.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> A less disorderly and drawn out debt restructuring process would 
          be to the benefit of all concerned. The citizens of the countries whose 
          debts are being restructured would benefit as the period of economic 
          dislocation is reduced. And creditors would gain since their asset values 
          are preserved.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>The SDRM would also increase the efficiency and stability of the global 
          financial system. By creating a more predictable environment for workouts 
          in cases of unsustainable debt burdens, the overall risk of lending 
          to emerging market countries would be reduced. This should lower the 
          costs of accessing markets for emerging market countries with strong 
          policies. Moreover, a more predictable restructuring framework should 
          also yield greater stability of capital flows, as uncertainty over the 
          modalities of a debt workout are reduced. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="a3"></a>A.3 How would SDRM contribute to crisis prevention 
        and crisis resolution?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> The SDRM would complement valuable reforms that have already been 
          undertaken in response to the emerging market financial crises of the 
          1990s.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> The SDRM would contribute to <em>crisis prevention.</em> By providing 
          greater clarity concerning the circumstances under which debt would 
          be restructured and the process that would be followed, private markets 
          would reduce lending to countries with already high debt-to-GDP ratios. 
          And by reinforcing the fact that the official sector is not waiting 
          on the sidelines to bail out imprudent creditors, it should help prevent 
          crises by discouraging over lending and over borrowing. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>In addition, SDRM would make <em>crisis resolution</em> more orderly 
          and less costly. First, it provides incentives for countries to face 
          up to their problems promptly, <em>before</em> the point of default. An 
          orderly and timely restructuring preserves considerable value for all 
          stakeholders, in contrast to a disorderly default where the value of 
          claims in the secondary market typically plummets. Second, in those 
          cases where resolution is necessary, there would be less debt to deal 
          with. However, it should be emphasized that the proposals would not 
          make restructuring an easy option, as the economic dislocation implied 
          by even an orderly workout could be considerable. Moreover, there is 
          no intention to reduce the incentives to service debt when it's still 
          feasible to do so. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="a4"></a>A.4 Is the SDRM a solution to the holdout (or &quot;rogue 
        creditor&quot;) problem? If so, how do you respond to the view that the 
        holdout problem has not been a big hindrance in sovereign debt restructurings 
        to date?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> One of the aims of the SDRM is to make it easier for a debtor that 
          reaches agreement with a super-majority of creditors to avoid holdouts. 
          But the SDRM is also intended to catalyze the creation of a restructuring 
          process that will help to resolve a range of other problems.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>The holdout problem is most acute prior to a default, when creditors 
          may consider that they have a reasonable prospect of continuing to be 
          paid in line with the original terms of their contracts. As a result 
          of the rational behavior of individual creditors, it may be difficult 
          to reach an agreement that would be in the interests of creditors as 
          a group.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> The holdout problem is probably less acute following a default, as 
          the options facing creditors&#8212;particularly those with no appetite 
          for litigation&#8212;have narrowed. It is worth noting, however, that 
          there have been recent holdout problems in Peru, the Congo, and some 
          creditors have started litigation against Argentina. More generally, 
          it is true that cases to date are few and that holdouts have not managed 
          to derail restructurings, although in some cases &quot;buying out&quot; 
          holdouts has had a cost. But the delays in reaching agreement with creditors 
          have imposed substantial economic costs on debtors and creditors alike.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> The holdout problem may become more prevalent in future, as successful 
          litigation by some creditors in one case may increase the incentives 
          for others to try it. In addition, the possibility that holdout creditors 
          can attach future payments on restructured debt and receive better treatment 
          than cooperating creditors distorts incentives and can derail efforts 
          for a cooperative restructuring. It is likely to be of particular importance 
          in cases in which the creditors are being asked to accept substantial 
          debt and debt service reduction. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Ideally, the SDRM would encourage a country with unsustainable debt 
          and its creditors to restructure <em>before </em>it gets to the point 
          where default is the only option. </li>
      </ul>
      
<h2><a name="b"></a>B. Features of the SDRM</h2>
      
<p><em><a name="b1"></a>B.1 What are the main features of the SDRM?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> A big enough majority (a <em>supermajority</em>) of creditors could 
          vote to accept new terms under a restructuring agreement. Minority creditors 
          would be prevented from blocking such agreements or enforcing the terms 
          of the original debt contracts&#8212;that is, they would be bound by 
          the decision of the supermajority.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> The SDRM would include a mechanism that would <em>deter disruptive 
          litigation</em> by creditors during the debt restructuring negotiations. 
          But there would be no automatic stay on enforcement. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Creditors would have assurance that the debtor will <em>negotiate in 
          good faith </em>and will pursue policies&#8212;most likely designed in 
          conjunction with seeking financial support from the IMF&#8212;that help 
          protect the value of creditor claims and help limit the dislocation 
          in the economy.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>The SDRM would establish <em>transparency requirements </em> that would, 
          among other things, enable creditors to have information about how other 
          creditors are being treated during the restructuring process.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Creditors could agree to give <em>seniority</em> and protection from 
          restructuring to fresh private lending, in order to facilitate ongoing 
          economic activity through the continued provision of trade and other 
          types of credit.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>A <em>dispute resolution forum </em>would be established to resolve 
          disputes that may arise during the voting process or when claims are 
          being verified. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="b2"></a>B.2 Will claims of the Paris Club (official bilateral 
        creditors) be included under the SDRM? </em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> It is likely that, in cases where Paris Club creditors have significant 
          claims, such debts would need to be covered in a comprehensive restructuring. 
          The question is whether they should be covered under the SDRM or whether 
          the restructuring should be done in parallel outside the framework, 
          relying on the Paris Club's existing restructuring practices. There 
          is some inclination to exclude Paris Club claims from the formal framework 
          of the SDRM; but we will continue to discuss how to proceed here with 
          the Paris Club and the private creditor community. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="b3"></a>B.3 Will sovereign domestic debt (i.e., sovereign 
        debt governed by domestic law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction 
        of the domestic courts) be covered by SDRM?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>No, not by the SDRM. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to 
          restructure sovereign domestic debt if the overall burden is to be reduced 
          to a sustainable level. And nonresident investors may only be willing 
          to provide substantial debt reduction if they know that domestic creditors 
          are shouldering a fair share of the burden too. But decisions on the 
          inclusion of domestic debt would have to be made on a case-by-case basis, 
          taking careful account of the different nature of these claims, as well 
          as the possible impacts on the value of the assets of the domestic banking 
          system and on the domestic capital market. In any event, domestic debt 
          would not be restructured under the SDRM, since governments typically 
          have at their disposal tools for restructuring domestic debt that are 
          not available in the case of external debt.</li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="b4"></a>B.4 Why shouldn't the claims of the IMF be brought 
        under SDRM? Why should the Fund have preferred creditor status?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> The IMF is not a commercial organization seeking profitable lending 
          opportunities. In fact, it often lends precisely at the point where 
          other creditors are reluctant to do so, and at interest rates that are 
          below those that would be charged at that juncture by the private sector. 
          In so doing, the IMF helps countries to catalyze private financing and 
          to avoid disorderly adjustment and policies that would harm themselves, 
          private creditors, and other countries. Putting IMF claims together 
          with commercial claims in a workout would fundamentally undermine the 
          Fund's capacity to play that vital role in future. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="b5"></a>B.5 What is the collective action clauses (CAC) approach? 
        How does the SDRM approach differ from the CAC approach?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Collective action clauses apply to individual bond issues. They would 
          permit a specified super-majority of holders of a particular bond issue 
          to agree to a restructuring that would be binding on all holders of 
          that issue. By preventing holdouts in individual bond issues, such clauses 
          would thereby facilitate any needed restructuring. The use of CACs would 
          be an improvement over the current system and the IMF is committed to 
          promoting their use among its member countries. But currently, most 
          bonds do not include these clauses.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> In a general restructuring, the CAC approach would require separate 
          decisions from holders of each individual bond issue. Creditors of issues 
          not accepting a restructuring offer would have the right to pursue their 
          interests in the courts in the country/state under whose laws the debt 
          instruments were issued. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>The SDRM proposal goes farther than CAC and could complement it nicely. 
          The SDRM is a more comprehensive approach than CAC because: <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>The SDRM would deal with the whole existing stock of debt, including 
              instruments that do not explicitly provide for collective action. 
              Even if CACs became more widely used in new bond contracts, the 
              CAC approach would still fail to cover existing instruments that 
              lack such clauses. <br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>The SDRM would allow a single vote to restructure multiple debt 
              instruments by aggregating the votes of creditors holding participating 
              debt instruments. In other words, the SDRM permits the debtor and 
              its creditors to act as if all of this debt were governed by a single 
              collective action clause.<br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>The SDRM would provide for an impartial dispute resolution process 
              to protect creditors against fraud. The difficulty in providing 
              such protection in the context of CACs has been a major impediment 
              to developing a contractual approach to aggregation.<br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>The SDRM would allow a super majority of creditors to approve 
              new money that could help limit the scope of economic dislocation 
              during the restructuring process. CACs do not have this feature.<br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>The SDRM would enter into force for all countries at the same 
              time. In contrast, there could be a &quot;first mover&quot; problem 
              associated with CACs&#8212;that is, emerging market economies might 
              resist including CACs in their bond issues fearing that investors 
              will interpret such inclusion as a signal that restructuring is 
              more likely and will thus require a higher risk premium.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="b6"></a>B.6 What are the parallels with domestic (national) 
        bankruptcy laws? </em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> The SDRM proposal has been inspired both by existing collective action 
          clauses and by the principles of domestic bankruptcy. As a result, it 
          has some similarities but also important differences with domestic bankruptcy 
          regimes. Both bankruptcy and the SDRM are designed to help a debtor 
          reorganize its finances and activities to restore debt payments by allowing 
          creditors to decide collectively on a restructuring. But the SDRM is 
          designed to leave crucial decisions to creditors and the debtor&#8212;and 
          thus to avoid the need to create the equivalent of a bankruptcy judge 
          that has the power to grant a debtor legal protection. In particular, 
          the SDRM does not include an automatic stay on the enforcement of creditors' 
          rights.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Of course, we must be cautious in drawing parallels between domestic 
          bankruptcy regimes and the sovereign context. In the latter, there is 
          no ultimate sanction of liquidation, policies are not supervised by 
          a bankruptcy court, and creditors cannot insist on a change in management. 
          We are not proposing a bankruptcy mechanism for countries, but simply 
          a mechanism to facilitate debt workout negotiations between a debtor 
          and its creditors. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
          Code, and the move in a number of European countries to adopt statutory 
          rehabilitation frameworks, reflects a recognition of the potential benefits 
          of moving rapidly to protect economic value and the interests of stakeholders&#8212;including 
          shareholders, creditors, and the labor force in the nonsovereign context. 
          The fact remains that both countries and their creditors would be well 
          served by moving rapidly to put debt into a sustainable basis. Market 
          failures that introduce unnecessary delays into this process lead to 
          debtors and their creditors to bear costs that are unduly large. </li>
      </ul>
      
<h2><a name="c"></a>C. Role of the IMF under the SDRM </h2>
      
<p><em><a name="c1"></a>C.1 What would be the role of the IMF under the SDRM?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> The proposal does not envision new legal powers for the existing 
          organs of the IMF. The decisions would be those of the debtor and a 
          supermajority of creditors or of an independent dispute resolution forum. 
          The IMF does not want to insert itself as judge or arbiter into the 
          middle of a restructuring discussion between debtor and creditors. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>At the same time, the IMF has a crucial role to play in enabling the 
          international community to reach a judgment on the sustainability of 
          a country's debt and the appropriateness of its economic policies. But 
          the Fund plays this role right now, even in the absence of the SDRM. 
          In cases where there is a Fund program, there has to be some degree 
          of consistency between the Fund's judgments about a sustainable economic 
          program and the feasible size of primary budget surpluses, on the one 
          hand, and the extent of restructuring agreed to by the creditors and 
          the debtors, on the other. At the end of the day, things have to add 
          up such that the agreed restructuring, financial support from the IMF, 
          financial support from other sources catalyzed by the IMF-supported 
          program, and the country's own efforts at adjustment succeed in restoring 
          the country to a sustainable situation. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>In broad terms, the Fund's role will continue to be what it has been 
          to date, namely that of signaling its willingness to support a country's 
          economic policies and providing financial assistance to members implementing 
          appropriate policies through an IMF-supported program. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="c2"></a>C.2 Would the introduction of the SDRM lead to smaller 
        or more selective financial support packages from the Fund?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> The international community's backing for such an approach would 
          reaffirm the principle that IMF financial support should be geared to 
          countries with (temporary) liquidity problems and not to countries with 
          unsustainable debts. So the proposal's effect should be to tilt Fund 
          financial support toward cases that are worthy of support and where 
          the Fund's resources can successfully address underlying problems. </li>
      </ul>
      
<h2><a name="d"></a>D. Concerns and Criticisms</h2>
      
<p><em><a name="d1"></a>D.1 How do you respond to the argument that the SDRM 
        would not have been of much help in the financial crises of the past decade?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> There has been great diversity in the types of financial crises in 
          the last decade, and no <em>single</em> instrument, the SDRM or any other, 
          would have been able to tackle every one of them. This diversity is 
          an argument for having more&#8212;not fewer&#8212;instruments in the 
          tool-kit for crisis prevention and resolution. SDRM would have helped 
          in crises where sovereign debt restructuring was a necessary part of 
          the solution.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>A question more relevant than how useful SDRM would have been in the 
          past is how helpful is it going to be in future. As more countries gain 
          access to private capital markets&#8212;which is an objective of the 
          international community&#8212;a framework for the more orderly resolution 
          of unsustainable debt situations (in those rare cases when they do arise) 
          would be of help.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>The SDRM is part of a package of reforms for crisis prevention and 
          better crisis resolution and should not be viewed in isolation. Other 
          elements of the package include improvements in assessments of debt 
          sustainability; strengthening the capacity to resolve banking system 
          difficulties; changes in IMF lending and access policies that will more 
          clearly prescribe the scale of IMF financial support; and streamlined 
          conditionality.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>In short, we are not proposing the SDRM in isolation, we are not proposing 
          it as a solution to all problems, and we are not pursuing it to the 
          exclusion of other needed reforms. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="d2"></a>D.2 Isn't the SDRM trying to fix something that &quot;ain't 
        broke&quot;? Russia, Ecuador, Pakistan, and Ukraine managed to restructure 
        their debts. Doesn't this show that current processes are doing the job?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> This is essentially an argument that we should continue to muddle 
          through sovereign debt crises. Debtor countries and their creditors 
          have paid large costs in recent cases of sovereign default. Some may 
          argue that bankruptcy <em>should</em> be messy&#8212;that the costs are 
          necessary to discipline debtors to avoid default. Our view is that the 
          costs at present are too high and too disruptive to the international 
          community as a whole (see A.1). Doing nothing is therefore not an option.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> Moreover, there were some special features in the cases mentioned 
          that would not be present in general. For instance, Ecuador made aggressive 
          use of exit consents and it is not clear that this strategy can be used 
          in the future&#8212;particularly if creditors change bond contracts 
          to make use of exit consents more difficult. In Pakistan's case, most 
          of the instruments were held by major Middle East institutions, reducing 
          the diversity of the creditor base. Most of Ukraine's bonds had collective 
          action clauses. And all three of these countries (Ecuador, Pakistan, 
          Ukraine) had only a handful of bonds. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="d3"></a>D.3 Wouldn't the SDRM override creditors' legitimate 
        rights to enforce claims?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> The latest SDRM proposal does not include provisions for the imposition 
          of an automatic stay on the enforcement of creditors' rights.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>What the SDRM would do is to redistribute powers from individual creditors 
          to a super-majority of creditors (which, it should be noted, is what 
          CACs would do as well). <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>The SDRM proposal contains many safeguards, including to prevent abuse, 
          provide for adequate transparency in the voting process, and protect 
          the seniority of credit.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Problems of coordination and collective action across a diverse group 
          of creditors are market failures that lead to major losses; correcting 
          them will in fact improve the value of creditors' claims. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="d4"></a>D.4 Wouldn't debtor countries use the SDRM too often?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Even with the SDRM, debt restructuring would be a costly option. 
          The prospect of economic dislocation, political upheaval, and damage 
          to the country's reputation in international capital markets would still 
          make countries loath to approach their creditors for a restructuring&#8212;let 
          alone default&#8212;on their debt service obligations in all but the 
          most extreme circumstances. Debt restructuring would remain an economically 
          painful process&#8212;and one that debtors would rightly remain reluctant 
          to enter into.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> In any case, the SDRM would be available only to countries whose 
          debts are unsustainable, and where debt restructuring is thus inevitable. 
          It is hard to argue that facilitating orderly debt workouts in such 
          cases would weaken the credit culture or create moral hazard. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="d5"></a>D.5 How do you respond to the concern that the SDRM 
        will lower capital flows to emerging markets and raise borrowing costs?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> No, quite the opposite. In the domestic context, the existence of 
          a bankruptcy law makes debt markets more efficient. In the United States 
          and in many other countries, corporate debt has long been subject to 
          bankruptcy proceedings, and yet corporate bond markets have thrived. 
          The same principle should hold for international capital markets. If 
          the SDRM is successful in reducing uncertainty surrounding the process 
          of restructuring, and provides effective incentives for debtors to approach 
          their creditors while there is money on the table and before full-blown 
          crises take hold&#8212;then recovery values on restructured debt should 
          increase, and the <em>cost of capital should decline</em>. It should also 
          increase the attractiveness of the asset class as a whole. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="d6"></a>D.6 What empirical evidence can we bring to bear 
        on the likely impact of the SDRM on the flows of capital to emerging markets 
        and on borrowing costs?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Anecdotal as well as more systematic empirical evidence on the impact 
          of collective action clauses on borrowing costs may be relevant to assessing 
          what would happen under the SDRM. When the G-10 report in 1996 first 
          advocated the use of collective action clauses, there was strong opposition 
          on the grounds that they would lead to higher borrowing costs. This 
          argument became much less persuasive when it was pointed out that these 
          clauses already existed in British trust-deed bonds. Likewise, several 
          data and news services that report in detail on each new bond issue 
          never explain the pricing of a bond in terms of the presence or absence 
          of collective action clauses. More systematic econometric investigations, 
          including a study presented at the IMF's annual research conference 
          in November 2002, have also failed to uncover any systematic impact 
          of collective action clauses on borrowing costs for the asset class 
          as a whole.</li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="d7"></a>D.7 How have officials of emerging market countries 
        reacted to the SDRM proposal?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> The IMFC, the governing body of the IMF which includes representatives 
          of both emerging markets and industrialized countries, expressed support 
          for the approach and asked for a full proposal for consideration at 
          their Spring 2003 meeting.</li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="d8"></a>D.8 How have creditor groups reacted to the SDRM 
        proposal? </em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Some have expressed concerns that debtor countries would use the 
          SDRM &quot;too often.&quot; But ultimately, a debtor cannot use the 
          SDRM without the consent of a supermajority of its creditors (see D.4 
          above).<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> There have also been questions about how the role of the IMF would 
          change once SDRM is in place, and questions on numerous technical and 
          legal questions about the specific design of the SDRM. These issues 
          are being further discussed with creditors, both from the financial 
          and legal community.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Other creditors recognize the potential gains to them from the SDRM 
          approach, and recognize that it would provide incentives for a more 
          structured and organized negotiation process with debtors. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="d9"></a>D.9 Is the SDRM targeted at the debt problems of 
        low-income countries?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li> No, the debt problems of low-income countries are being dealt with 
          under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative. The SDRM addresses 
          issues concerning sovereign debt to private sector creditors, and is 
          thus more relevant to emerging market countries that have borrowed on 
          international capital markets. That said, there are a small number of 
          countries eligible for assistance under the HIPC initiative that also 
          have large debt outstanding to private creditors; the SDRM could be 
          relevant to their situation as well.</li>
      </ul>
      
<p><em><a name="d10"></a>D.10 Why shouldn't countries be allowed to use the 
        SDRM to disqualify &quot;odious&quot; debt (i.e., debt related to arms 
        purchases, debt accumulated by previous non-democratic or corrupt regimes, 
        etc.)? </em> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> One of the key principles underlying the SDRM is that any interference 
          with contractual relations should be limited to those measures that 
          are necessary to resolve the most important collective action problems. 
          But disqualifying &quot;odious&quot; debt would involve a radical change 
          in the validity of creditor claims and the sanctity of contracts, which 
          would have adverse implications for the operation of capital markets. 
          It would introduce a new risk factor over and beyond the nature of credit 
          and the repayment terms. It would undermine the efficient operation 
          of secondary markets, and have an adverse effect on emerging market 
          borrowers to make issues in primary markets. </li>
      </ul>
      <em><a name="d11"></a>D.11 Why should a country with an unsustainable debt 
      burden try so hard to avoid default? Why not just repudiate the debt, and 
      use the savings to bolster spending on domestic health, education, and infrastructure?</em> 
      <ul>
        <li> The costs of the economic turmoil that typically follow a default 
          are enormous. And many of these costs are likely to be even larger if 
          the debt is repudiated&#8212;that is, if no effort is made to restructure 
          its repayment. Such costs would far outweigh the short-term gains. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li> The balance of payments crisis that results from a default is invariably 
          more severe than otherwise. A default&#8212;and particularly a repudiation&#8212;undermines 
          confidence that the government will respect property rights. Will domestic 
          bank assets be confiscated? Will the rights of investors holding equity 
          or owning businesses be curtailed? The consequence is capital flight 
          and a large reversal of inflows.<br />
          <br />
          Argentina 2002 vs. Brazil 1999 is an excellent example of how much higher 
          the costs can be under default than under a &quot;mere&quot; currency 
          crisis by itself. <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Brazil suffered a currency crisis in 1999. Debt flows collapsed, 
              but were offset by a boom in FDI owing to the bargain-basement prices 
              that were available after the devaluation.<br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>Argentina suffered a currency crisis and then defaulted in 2002. 
              Both debt and FDI flows collapsed, and the net capital outflows 
              were much higher than in the case of Brazil. In spite of the devaluation 
              and bargain-basement prices, investors feared that they might not 
              be able to repatriate profits or that they would be subject to confiscatory 
              measures, or worse. <br />
              <br />
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The domestic financial system is usually devastated by a default, 
          since banks typically hold large amounts of government debt. Credit, 
          and even intermediation, are severely impacted, and output collapses. 
          Even if the government manages to selectively default on external credits 
          only, the reversal of capital flows that follows from the default will 
          put a severe strain on the financial system.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>International trade often declines following a sovereign default. 
          This can result as trade credit dries up, and also because creditors 
          may wish to punish the defaulter or dissuade the country from defaulting 
          again in future. The latter effect should be especially important in 
          the case of debt repudiation. Andrew Rose (University of California-Berkeley) 
          has found that the decline in bilateral trade suffered by sovereign 
          defaulters adds up to about a year's worth of trade spread out over 
          15 years.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Future access to capital markets can be impeded and borrowing costs 
          are likely to remain high for a long time. Historically, countries that 
          defaulted on their external debts lost access to international capital 
          markets until they reached an acceptable settlement with their creditors. 
          But even after settlement, interest rates on new borrowing tended to 
          remain high, at least until a good track record was (re-) established. 
          Empirical studies have shown that countries that wrote down their debts 
          in the late 1980s under the Brady plan still face higher borrowing costs 
          today as a consequence.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Expenditures on health, education, and infrastructure are extremely 
          important. In the long run, countries that maintain investor confidence 
          and good access to international credit markets are able to finance 
          much more generous social and infrastructure expenditures than countries 
          that are isolated from the global financial community.</li>
