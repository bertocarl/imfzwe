        <p align="center"><b><a name="I"></a>I. Introduction </b> 
        <p>1. On June 3, 2002, the Executive Board held further discussions on 
          possible revisions to the formulas used to calculate members' quotas. 
          <sup><a href="#P61_1045">1</a></sup> A measure of openness has traditionally 
          been included in the quota formulas in the form of a variable containing 
          the sum of current receipts and current payments, and most Directors 
          reiterated their support for the continued inclusion of such an openness 
          variable. Directors also discussed broadening the openness measure by 
          including in the formulas a variable such as the international investment 
          position (IIP), specifically to capture financial openness. However, 
          as noted in SM/02/132, and during the Board discussion, it would not 
          at this stage be possible to include the IIP for all member countries 
          given that many countries do not at present report comprehensive IIP 
          data. In view of the interest in including the IIP in the quota formulas, 
          many Directors encouraged additional work to improve the collection 
          and reporting of IIP data.
        <p>2. The IIP, as a balance sheet, is also important for vulnerability 
          assessment because it provides a snap shot of the levels, sectoral distribution, 
          and maturity of a country's external liabilities (e.g., external debt) 
          and also the size and composition of its external claims (e.g., international 
          reserves and banks' foreign claims) that may be available to meet its 
          external obligations. In their meeting on data provision to the Fund 
          for surveillance on May 10, 2002, Directors noted that data for vulnerability 
          assessment should include frequent and comprehensive data on international 
          reserves; detailed data on IIPs and capital flows; maturity profile 
          and repayment schedules of external and public sector debt; and financial 
          soundness indicators, including corporate sector data. <sup><a href="#P64_2789">2</a></sup> 
          <sup><a href="#P65_2935">3</a></sup> The objective should be to work 
          toward compiling the above data with the necessary detail depending 
          on country circumstances and characteristics and in line with the relevant 
          statistical methodologies.
        <p>3. IIP statistics are also among the items of information that members 
          are required to report to the Fund under <A HREF="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/aa/aa08.htm#5">Article VIII, Section 5</A> of 
          the Articles of Agreement. More specifically, Article VIII, Section 
          5 (a) (vii) requires members to provide information on the &quot;international 
          investment position, i.e., investments within the territories of the 
          member owned abroad and investments abroad owned by persons in its territories 
          so far as it is possible to furnish this information.&quot; In recent 
          years, the Fund has impressed upon countries the need to furnish such 
          information and staff reports have informed the Directors of these matters. 
          <sup><a href="#P68_4005">4</a></sup> In determining whether a member 
          has complied with its obligation under Article VIII, Section 5, the 
          Fund must take into account the member's ability to provide the relevant 
          information.
        <p>4. In light of the prominence given to openness and vulnerability indicators 
          at recent Executive Board discussions, this paper has been prepared 
          for the information of Directors. It discusses the present state of 
          the IIP data and a number of Statistics Department (STA) initiatives 
          to assist countries to compile these statistics. Section II describes 
          the data on IIPs that are currently available to STA, while Section 
          III highlights some of the difficulties that countries face in undertaking 
          new IIP compilations. Section IV describes some of the tools provided 
          by STA and its inter-agency partners that facilitate the compilation 
          of IIP statistics. Section V reviews several initiatives to develop 
          further the IIP statistics in member countries and responds to Directors' 
          request that additional work on data issues related to IIPs be undertaken. 
          Section VI presents conclusions. 
        <p align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>II. Present State of the Data</b> 
        <p>5. The IIP represents at a particular point in time an economy's balance 
          sheet showing its stock of external financial assets and liabilities. 
          The IIP consists of claims on nonresidents, liabilities to nonresidents, 
          monetary gold, and SDRs. The difference between an economy's external 
          financial assets and liabilities is the economy's net IIP. As the IIP 
          is a comprehensive framework covering the complete range of a country's 
          external assets and liabilities, the source data requirements are so 
          extensive that it is most often compiled on an annual basis. However, 
          in some countries it is compiled quarterly. 
        <p>6. The fourth edition of the <i>Balance of Payments Manual (BPM4)</i>, 
          published in 1977, defined the IIP but did not present a framework and 
          a set of standard components. The fifth edition of the Fund's <i>Balance 
          of Payments Manual</i> (<i>BPM5</i>), which was published in 1993, first 
          addressed IIP statistics comprehensively. Twenty-five countries reported 
          IIP data to the IMF in 1993. 
        <p>7. The IMF began publication of balance of payments and IIP data on 
          the <i>BPM5</i> basis in 1995. STA regularly invited countries to contribute 
          annual IIP data, including partial data, for publication in the <i>Balance 
          of Payments Statistics Yearbook</i> and in <i>International Financial 
          Statistics</i>. By end-2000, the number of reporting countries had risen 
          steadily, and STA published IIP statistics for 63 countries.
        <p>8. STA initiated an outreach program in early 2001 by writing to central 
          bank governors and heads of statistical agencies to encourage those 
          countries not reporting IIP data to bolster their efforts to do so and 
          to encourage those countries reporting partial data to report more comprehensively. 
          As of end-July 2002, STA's database contained IIP data for 80 countries. 
          Three quarters of these countries reported comprehensive data; <sup><a href="#P80_7043">5</a></sup> 
          the remainder provided partial data (see <a href="#a1">Appendix 1</a>). 
        <p>9. In addition to the 80 countries that report IIP data to STA, the 
          majority of other IMF member countries compile data on selected components 
          of their external sector position, and these data provide useful information 
          with which to construct important elements of an IIP statement. As well, 
          these partial data are often available with greater periodicity and 
          timeliness than the full IIP statement. These include data on the following: 
        <ul>
          <li> International reserves.
            <p>
          <li> Other monetary and financial statistics, which includes data on 
            the foreign assets and liabilities of the monetary authorities, deposit 
            money banks, and nonbank financial institutions.
            <p>
          <li> External debt statistics. Although data may not be available for 
            the private nonbank sector, many countries compile data on the external 
            debt of the government sector and frequently also cover the external 
            debt of government enterprises. 
            <p>
          <li> More selectively, countries also gather external position data 
            from administrative information, such as portfolio investment positions 
            from stock exchanges, direct investment information from investment 
            approval agencies, etc.
        </ul>
        <p align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>III. Difficulties in Compiling 
          IIP Data</b> 
        <p align="center"><b><a name="P94_8418"></a>A. Survey on Implementation 
          of <i>BPM5</i></b>
        <p>10. The difficulties that countries face in compiling IIP statistics, 
          including the considerable resources involved, have been emphasized 
          on various occasions. In early 1995, STA conducted a survey of its members 
          to assess progress they were making in implementing the guidelines of 
          the <i>BPM5</i>. Of the more than 50 responses received, many of the 
          developing and emerging market countries indicated that they found or 
          anticipated finding the greatest difficulty in implementing IIP collections, 
          noting especially the lack of reliable data on private sector investment 
          positions, particularly in view of the liberalization of capital controls 
          that had taken place in recent years. They also cited the need to develop 
          new surveys, to secure greater intragovernmental cooperation, and to 
          overcome difficulties in estimating the market value of certain international 
          assets. <sup><a href="#P97_9322">6</a></sup>
        <p align="center"><b><a name="P99_9449"></a>B. Conference on Capital Flow 
          and Debt Statistics</b>
        <p>11. More recently, compilers had an opportunity to voice concerns regarding 
          calls for improved external debt statistics, which are an important 
          component of the IIP. In February 2000, the IMF, in cooperation with 
          the Financial Stability Forum's Working Party on Capital Flows, sponsored 
          a conference on capital flow and debt statistics. At this conference 
          some 120 senior-level data users, policy makers, and data compilers 
          considered what actions and resources would be required to provide better 
          and more timely data on capital flows and external debt and what actions 
          should be given priority. <sup><a href="#P102_10095">7</a></sup>
        <p>12. At the conference, policymakers, data users, and some compilers 
          stressed the need for more comprehensive and timely capital flow and 
          external debt statistics. Data compilers from industrial countries and 
          offshore centers generally viewed the dissemination of such data as 
          a lower priority, which reflected national statistical priorities as 
          well as concerns regarding resources, compilation difficulties, and 
          respondent burden. Most data compilers felt pressured to produce more 
          timely and comprehensive data, but many lacked the necessary additional 
          resources to undertake the work. Compilers pointed out that respondents 
          to national statistical surveys had expressed concerns about increased 
          demands. <sup><a href="#P105_11015">8</a></sup> A number of participants 
          also pointed out that a key issue to address was the undercoverage of 
          the activity of the nonbank private sector, but this sector was often 
          reluctant to provide data. <sup><a href="#P106_11708">9</a></sup> All 
          of these issues must be addressed when compilers decide to compile IIP 
          statistics. 
        <p align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>IV. Tools to Facilitate Compilation 
          of IIP Statistics</b> 
        <p>13. A number of tools have been developed to assist countries in their 
          efforts to compile and disseminate IIP statistics. These include statistical 
          manuals and compilation guides, the conduct of coordinated surveys under 
          the auspices of the Fund, and research activities undertaken by international 
          statistical committees and task forces. In the five examples given below, 
          STA strives to coordinate these and other initiatives to ensure consistency 
          across countries and conformity with agreed international statistical 
          guidelines.
        <p align="center"><b><a name="P112_12560"></a>A. Methodological Materials, 
          Training, and Technical Assistance</b>
        <p>14. The IMF and its inter-agency partners facilitate the efforts of 
          countries to compile IIP statistics through the provision of methodological 
          materials, training, and technical assistance. In addition to the <i>BPM5</i>, 
          the IMF published in 1995 the <i>Balance of Payments Compilation Guide</i>, 
          which provides practical guidance for using sources and methods to compile 
          the balance of payments and IIP statistics. The <i>Guide</i> presents 
          the relative strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches and 
          notes source data adjustments required to derive, in conformity with 
          recommendations of the <i>BPM5</i>, data on flows and stocks. The <i>BPM5</i> 
          and the <i>Guide</i>, together with the <i>Balance of Payments Textbook</i>, 
          form a trilogy of publications that provide a comprehensive range of 
          information on the compilation of balance of payments and IIP statistics. 
          <sup><a href="#P115_13454">10</a></sup> The IMF uses this trilogy in 
          its training program at headquarters and in regional training institutes 
          as well as in its technical assistance program.
        <p>15. To train compilers on the concepts and methodologies set out in 
          the <i>BPM5</i>, the first IMF Institute balance of payments course 
          based on the new methodology was offered in late 1992. <sup><a href="#P118_13916">11</a></sup> 
          In the following years, the training program was expanded to encompass 
          the various regional training institutes that had opened. In 2000, training 
          in external debt statistics was introduced. In 2001, STA conducted 14 
          training courses and seminars in external sector statistics. In total, 
          some 350 persons received training in balance of payments, IIP, and 
          external debt compilation in that year. In 2002, there are plans to 
          conduct 13 courses and seminars in external sector statistics. The number 
          of training courses and seminars offered in each of the past two years 
          was more than double the number offered in each of the preceding four 
          years, which reflected increased training due to preparations for the 
          2001 Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey and the introduction of 
          the new external debt guide (see below).
        <p>16. In addition to training, STA has an intensive program of technical 
          assistance in balance of payments statistics and has responded positively 
          to requests from member countries for technical assistance in the development 
          of IIP statistics and other facets of implementing <i>BPM5</i> guidelines. 
          On average, STA has conducted about 30 short- and long-term technical 
          assistance missions a year in external sector statistics since the end 
          of 1996.
        <p>17. Related to these activities, the number of countries reporting 
          balance of payments statistics in the format of the <i>BPM5</i> has 
          grown to 144 <sup><a href="#P123_15383">12</a></sup> and, as previously 
          indicated, 80 countries currently report IIP statistics.
        <p align="center"><b><a name="P126_15523"></a>B. IMF Committee on Balance 
          of Payments Statistics</b>
        <p>18. The terms of reference of the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments 
          Statistics, which was formed in 1992, includes a requirement to &quot;bring 
          to the attention of the IMF new developments that impact on the compilation 
          of statistics on cross-border transactions or related stocks of financial 
          assets and liabilities, and work with the IMF in determining how these 
          activities should be treated in accordance with the <i>BPM5</i>.&quot; 
          Each year, the Committee reviews a number of methodological issues that 
          have an impact on external sector statistics. In 2001, these included, 
          inter alia, the statistical treatment of nonperforming loans, employee 
          stock options, and repurchase agreements and securities lending, and 
          the statistical definition of resident units, such as special purpose 
          entities in offshore financial centers. The Committee's program of work 
          helps STA to stay abreast of statistical developments in the rapidly 
          changing environment of globalization and in turn to inform national 
          compilers in the Committee's <i>Annual Report</i> and in the <i>Balance 
          of Payments Statistics Newsletter</i>, both of which are on the IMF's 
          external website.
        <p align="center"><b><a name="P130_16704"></a>C. Coordinated Portfolio 
          Investment Survey</b>
        <p>19. Portfolio investment is a significant component in many countries' 
          IIP, and the Fund-sponsored Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey 
          (CPIS) helps countries develop stock data on portfolio investment assets 
          on a consistent basis in accordance with the <i>BPM5</i> methodology. 
          The 2001 CPIS is underway and preliminary results are expected towards 
          the end of 2002. Sixty-nine countries and jurisdictions, including a 
          significant number of offshore financial centers, participated in the 
          2001 CPIS compared with the 29 major investing countries that participated 
          in the first survey (end 1997). The 2001 CPIS will provide more comprehensive 
          global information on cross-border ownership of portfolio investment 
          securities (equities and debt securities). The objectives of the surveys 
          are (i) to collect comprehensive information on the geographical distribution 
          of cross-border holdings of foreign portfolio investment securities 
          for use in the compilation and/or improvement of IIP statistics and 
          (ii) to exchange, with the assistance of STA, the bilateral data collected 
          in the national surveys. The data exchanged provide creditor-source 
          measures of countries' external indebtedness reflecting nonresident 
          holdings of debt securities issued by individual countries. 
        <p>20. In May 2002, the IMF wrote to its member countries to inform them 
          of the decision taken by the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics 
          to conduct the CPIS on an annual basis and to invite countries' continued 
          participation. The response received to date has been overwhelmingly 
          positive. STA expects that the 2002 CPIS will reflect further improvements 
          in the coverage and methodology, which will provide more authoritative 
          global statistics as well as improved data for IIP compilation at the 
          national level. The CPIS contributes a very important component in the 
          development of a comprehensive IIP statement by countries. The <i>Coordinated 
          Portfolio Investment Survey Guide</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> edition, 2002), 
          which was prepared to assist countries to participate in the CPIS, provides 
          practical guidance on conducting different kinds of portfolio investment 
          surveys.
        <p align="center"><b><a name="P136_18875"></a>D. Inter-Agency Task Force 
          on Finance Statistics</b>
        <p>21. Two important initiatives to improve access to and understanding 
          of data on external debt were launched in 1998 in conjunction with the 
          work program of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Finance Statistics. <sup><a href="#P139_19130">13</a></sup> 
          First, since March 1999 the Joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank Statistics 
          on External Debt, <sup><a href="#P140_19405">14</a></sup> which are 
          quarterly releases of statistics on external debt for 176 developing 
          and transition countries, have been disseminated on the websites of 
          several of the Task Force members. Although these data do not provide 
          a comprehensive and consistent measure of a country's external debt, 
          they do bring together the best and most timely internationally comparative 
          data currently available on external debt. Perhaps the most important 
          component of these series is the BIS international banking statistics, 
          which provide a perspective of countries' external liabilities to and 
          claims on nonresident banks, both for the bank and nonbank sectors.
        <p>22. The BIS has undertaken a considerable amount of work to improve 
          the coverage and classification of the international banking statistics 
          so that they can be used by statisticians for compiling and/or checking 
          certain categories of external claims. STA has on several occasions 
          informed national compilers of the availability of these data and their 
          use for statistical compilation. The BIS also makes available to central 
          banks data from its international securities database, which provide 
          compilers with information on the securities issued abroad by entities 
          resident in their countries. These data can also be used for compiling 
          and/or checking country balance of payments and IIP data.
        <p>23. Second, the Task Force undertook to prepare, in close consultation 
          with national compilers of external debt and balance of payments statistics, 
          new international guidance on external debt statistics. In December 
          2001, a final draft of <i>External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers 
          and Users</i>, subject only to editing, was posted on the IMF's external 
          website, along with the other statistical manuals. <sup><a href="#P145_21260">15</a></sup> 
          <sup> <a href="#P146_21414">16</a></sup> The <i>Guide</i> provides guidance 
          on (i) the concepts, definitions, and classifications of external debt 
          data; (ii) the sources and techniques for compiling these data; and 
          (iii) the analytical use of these data. <sup><a href="#P147_21818">17</a></sup> 
          The <i>Guide</i> is intended to be of use to both compilers and users 
          of external debt statistics.
        <p align="center"><b><a name="P149_22039"></a>E. Direct Investment Methodology</b>
        <p>24. In 1997, the Fund and the OECD conducted a survey on country data 
          sources, collection methods, and dissemination and methodological practices 
          for direct investment statistics. The survey results were published 
          and additional details were made available electronically to balance 
          of payments compilers and staff of international organizations. <sup><a href="#P152_22418">18</a></sup> 
          An update was conducted in 2001 and the results-summary report as well 
          as detailed metadata for most of the participating countries-are expected 
          to be published in 2002. This information is an aid to countries to 
          compare their practices for consistency with <i>BPM5</i> methodology 
          and to introduce and/or revise surveys on foreign direct investment, 
          an important component in the IIPs of most countries. 
        <p align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>V. Other Work in Progress to Encourage 
          Compilation of IIP Statistics</b> 
        <p>25. An increase in the number of IIP-reporting countries and in the 
          comprehensiveness of reported data can be achieved only by a significant 
          effort by the countries themselves, given the complexity of the work 
          and the significant resource costs to national compilers and data providers. 
          In response to Directors' request that additional work on data issues 
          related to IIPs be undertaken, the following are several initiatives 
          in train that have important implications for the development of IIP 
          statistics: 
        <p>26. First, has been the inclusion of the IIP in the IMF's Special Data 
          Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The transition period for the dissemination 
          of IIP data expired on December 31, 2001, and, therefore, data for this 
          date should have been disseminated no later than June 30, 2002. The 
          SDDS requires annual data to be disseminated with six months timeliness; 
          however, subscribers who have begun disseminating data for the new quarterly 
          external debt data category may take up to nine months to disseminate 
          their IIP, as explained below. <sup><a href="#P159_24083">19</a></sup>
        <p>27. By July 31, 37 subscribers had disseminated complete IIP data on 
          their national web sites. Of the remaining thirteen subscribers, one 
          is using a fiscal year ending in March and therefore IIP data are to 
          be disseminated by end-September, five are using available flexibility 
          options for timeliness, and another three have chosen to begin disseminating 
          quarterly external debt data ahead of schedule-the transition period 
          ends in March 2003-to avail themselves of the additional three-months' 
          timeliness for disseminating IIP data. Two countries have disseminated 
          partial annual IIP data and are working with Fund staff in addressing 
          outstanding coverage issues. Two subscribers are working with Fund staff 
          in addressing outstanding coverage issues on quarterly external debt, 
          in order to avail themselves of an additional three-months' timeliness 
          for disseminating IIP data.
        <p>28. Second, a guidance paper-<i>International Investment Position: 
          A Guide to Data Sources</i>-on the practical aspects of IIP compilation 
          is being finalized and will be transmitted to countries that do not 
          report IIP data to STA. The paper's major focus is a discussion of data 
          sources that may be used to construct IIP statistics and to provide 
          practical guidance on IIP compilation. The covering letter to national 
          compilers would stress the growing importance of IIP statistics and 
          emphasize that the objective should be to work toward compiling the 
          data with the necessary detail depending on country circumstances and 
          characteristics, and in line with the relevant statistical methodologies. 
          For example, for many countries these components would include foreign 
          direct investment and private sector external debt, while for others 
          it would be for foreign asset holdings. 
        <p>29. Third, in collaboration with the Policy Development and Review 
          Department, the support of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Finance Statistics 
          has been sought in developing, at the country level, improved data for 
          vulnerability assessment. In the Executive Board paper on data provision 
          to the IMF, discussed on May 10, 2002, balance sheet data on the basis 
          of the IIP was among the identified data requirements for vulnerability 
          assessment. Following a meeting of the Task Force last May, this initiative 
          will identify, inter alia, repositories of information that could be 
          used to make an assessment of data gaps across a broad range of countries. 
          A paper will be prepared that will prioritize data requirements and 
          also examine how to motivate countries further to introduce or expand 
          statistical collections in this area. 
        <p align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>VI. Conclusions</b> 
        <p>30. While much has been achieved in recent years in improving the availability 
          of IIP data, more member countries need to make the necessary commitment 
          to compile IIP statistics and to provide the necessary resources to 
          develop appropriate compilation systems for those data series most relevant 
          to their circumstances. STA will continue to support this work through 
          its training and technical assistance programs, as well as updating, 
          as required, international statistical guidelines. Area Departments 
          can also be encouraged to engage countries to compile IIP statistics 
          when this information is needed for surveillance. 
        <p>31. The process of establishing comprehensive IIP collections will 
          take time, and it is likely to be many years before a global IIP statement 
          can be compiled along the lines as produced for balance of payments 
          statistics. <sup><a href="#P172_27685">20</a></sup> The more difficult 
          areas include data on foreign direct investment and other nonbank private 
          sector external assets and liabilities. As noted earlier, countries 
          are making good progress in the development of data on portfolio investment 
          assets through their participation in the CPIS. 
        <p>32. The staff intends to update Directors further on this work in the 
          context of discussions on the Sixth Review of Fund's Data Standards' 
          Initiatives and on Data Provision to the Fund for Surveillance that 
          are expected to come to the Board in the second half of 2003.<br>
